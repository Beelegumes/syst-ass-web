The value of long term monitoring plots for plant systematics and ecology in the tropics</h3>
<address>Toby Pennington, Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh<br />
Tim Baker, University of Leeds</address>
<h3>Theme</h3>
<p>Ecologists have established a large number of permanent inventory plots across 
the tropics, focussed on understanding the controls of ecosystem structure and function, 
or maintenance of alpha diversity. These plots offer a great deal to systematists 
for completing the biotic inventory of the tropics, both in terms of species discovery 
and understanding distributions. Such links would also benefit ecologists, as once 
the organisms in these plots are described and identified consistently among sites, 
a wide range of other questions, such as the controls of beta diversity, can be addressed. 
Finally, a suite of new, interdisciplinary questions may emerge from such collaborations: 
on the soils, climate, and traits of plants, they represent fertile ground for studies 
of evolutionary ecology and biogeography</p>

<a name="symposium2"></a><h3>Symposium 2 (28 August)<br /><br />
Comparative approaches to the origin of biodiversity</h3>
<address>Colin Hughes (principal), Institute of Systematic Botany, Zurich<br />
Matt Friedman, University of Oxford</address>
<address> </address>
<h3>Theme</h3>
<p>Variation in the tempo of species and trait evolution through time and among 
lineages are striking and universal features of evolutionary diversification. The 
reasons why some lineages diversify rapidly and others not at all, why some clades 
are species-rich and others are not, and the underlying factors determining these 
differences, are fundamental to understanding how life became so diverse. Several 
recent developments are transforming our ability to understand the tempo of species 
and trait evolution and the overall evolutionary dynamics of species diversification: 
(i) the development of more sophisticated and powerful tools for modeling trajectories 
of diversification and for combining neontological and paleontological evidence; (ii) 
the proliferation of new molecular phylogenetic data, for many more clades spanning 
broader taxonomic, geographical and temporal levels; (iii) the assembly of more comprehensive 
species geographic distribution, functional and life history trait data sets. These 
developments are providing exciting new insights into rates of evolutionary diversification 
across time and space. This symposium will explore these questions and developments 
with contributions encompassing both methodological issues and empirical studies 
of large clades spanning the Tree of Life.</p>

<a name="symposium3"></a><h3>Symposium 3 (28 August)<br /><br />
Accelerating the pace of taxonomy</h3>
<address>Robert Scotland, University of Oxford,<br />
Quentin Wheeler, New York</address>
<h3>Theme</h3>
<p>A major threat of the biodiversity crisis is that we will never learn everything 
we would wish to know about the origins, evolution, and organization of the biosphere. 
Some knowledge is key to understanding the functions of complex ecosystems. Other 
knowledge is key to piecing together the multi-billion-year history of life on our 
planet and making wise conservation decisions. Historically, a great deal of what 
we know of biodiversity has been captured through revisionary taxonomy and monography. 
The broadly comparative aspect of monographs means that they remain the most time-efficient 
and effective way to reassess existing data and add new data for large numbers of 
species. That said it is impossible to revise all taxa or address all 
gaps in knowledge at the same time. We must not only decide how to prioritize which 
taxa to monograph first, but also the sequence and relative emphasis to place on 
various categories of knowledge. The answer may be a mosaic of meeting 
various high priority objectives but this still requires difficult decisions regard 
priorities and distribution of limited resources. All of this would be challenging 
under any circumstance, but with the new reality of the biodiversity crisis knowledge 
of some species and information about them is literally a now or never proposition. 
While recent commentary on the global inventory of all species on Earth has largely 
focused on the size and extent of the remaining task in terms of numbers of species 
awaiting discovery and technological tools that aid in that discovery, a very real 
need exists to carefully examine the process of monography and to assure that what 
we are proceeding as effectively as possible. This includes identifying those aspects 
of traditional monographic work that are valuable and should be preserved as well 
as new approaches that add speed or quality to the work. This symposium will address 
how we can accelerate the pace of producing taxonomic revisions and monographs for 
species-rich clades.</p>

<a name="symposium4"></a><h3>Symposium 4 (27 August)<br /><br />
Rooted in deep time: Palaeontological contributions to systematics</h3>
<address>Roger Benson, University of Oxford<br />
Matt Friedman, University of Oxford<br />
Paul Smith, Director, Oxford University Museum of Natural History</address>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Theme</h3>
<p>Palaeontology provides unique data with a bearing on the evolutionary history 
of biological lineages. This symposium will survey the Tree of Life, examining the 
impact that fossils make on hypothesized relationships, sequences of character change, 
and timings of major divergences in a series of major clades ranging from single-celled 
plankton to mammals. Specifically, this symposium sets out to examine: (i) the ways 
in which extreme variability of the fossil record across biological groups influences 
approaches to systematic questions in different clades; (ii) the way in which incomplete 
or biased preservation of biological structures might bias phylogenetic inference; 
(iii) the relevance of palaeontological data for exposing instances of homoplasy 
in extant groups that might otherwise lead to erroneous systematic hypotheses; (iv) 
the role of fossils in atomizing sequences of character change leading to modern 
clades. Apart from exploring these major themes, our symposium sets out to summarize 
relationships and evolutionary history for conspicuous branches of the Tree of Life 
in light of fossils, paralleling similar efforts completed largely or exclusively 
with recent data.</p>

for the Diocese of Oxford. It has a world famous Cathedral Choir; scholarly collections 
of books and art; and is enjoyed by many people as visitors or guests at conferences 
and Summer schools.</p>

<p>All bedrooms have tea and coffee making facilities and a fridge.  Towels are 
provided along with a small soap, shampoo and body lotion in a pack.  There are 
laundry facilities in the college and a limited number of irons and ironing boards.  
Delegates would have to go to a particular room to do their ironing as the irons 
are attached to the wall because of Health and Safety.  There are hairdryers in 
ensuite bedrooms. Where possible, rooms will be in the old part of the college and 
breakfast will be served in the main Christ Church hall.</p>

<li>Twin Set Standard Bedroom - Twin Standard 'Set' (the picture happens to be in Peckwater Quad).  In these twin standard bedrooms the main door opens onto a shared sitting room.  Each delegate would have their own small bedroom with a handbasin.  Each bedroom has a door, so there is some privacy.  Bathrooms and loos are along the corridor or down/up a flight (sometimes two flights!) of stairs.  These rooms would be better suited to younger people, who don't mind a more 'basic' set up!</li>
<li>Single and Twin Ensuite Bedrooms - These rooms have a basin along with toilet and shower.</li>
<li>Single Standard Bedroom - The same as a single ensuite bedroom but without a toilet and shower.</li>
</ol>
