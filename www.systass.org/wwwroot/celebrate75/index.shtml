          History
        </p>
        <div class="textsmall">
          The Systematics Association was founded on 25th June
          1937 with Sir Julian Huxley at its head. Its role was
          to provide a forum for the discussion of the general
          theoretical and practical problems of taxonomy. Since
          then, the Association has pioneered discussion on the
          many new developments in systematics: over 50 Special
          Volumes have been published, focusing on groups as
          diverse as haptophyte algae, tetrapods, lichens,
          free-living flagellates and haematophagous insects.,
          and on fields such as phylogenetic reconstruction,
          systematics and conservation, genome evolution and the
          emergence of the biosphere. In 2012, seventy-five years
          after its creation, the role of the Systematics
          Association remains to represent and further all
          aspects of Systematic biology. The Association
          organises a Biennial conference and a Young
          Systematists' forum, to bring up-and-coming, as well as
          established systematists, together; it also funds
          special symposia. It continues to publish special
          volumes, and, with the Linnean Society, supports
          systematics through its Systematics Research Fund.

          2012 marks the 75th anniversary of the Systematics
          Association. In honour of this grand birthday, the
          Association will be hosting a special event,
          <strong>'Celebrating Systematics'</strong>, on
          <strong>20th June at the Natural History
          Museum</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The evening will be launched by the President of the
          Systematics Association, Professor Juliet Brodie,
          followed by a short history of the Association,
          presented by Professor Stephen Blackmore and Dr David
          Williams. After a drinks reception, during which guests
          will peruse a selection of posters from Systematics
          Research Fund grant holders, we will hear Sir David
          Attenborough and Professor Richard Fortey in
          conversation. Our two honourable guests will give their
          thoughts on the impact of systematics on the scientific
          world, as well as sharing a few anecdotes. The grand
          finale will be a buffet: a chance to mingle with fellow
          systematists to celebrate the achievements of our
          Association over the last three quarters of a century.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the evening's events are for ticket holders
          only, a <strong>Nature Live</strong> show, open to all, will
          take place at 14.30 in the <strong>Sir David Attenborough
          Studio</strong>. Systematists will present their latest
          research to the public, showing off the weird and
          wonderful organisms to which they dedicate their time!
