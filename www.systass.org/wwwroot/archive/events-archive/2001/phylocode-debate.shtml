          Australian Systematic Biologists, 16-18 July 2001,
          University of Melbourne."

        <p class="Normal">
          <strong>an unpublished talk reproduced with the
          permission of Gary Nelson</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="Line">
           
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          Phylocode claims to be a new and alternative system of
          nomenclature for botany and zoology.
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          It exists as a draft document on the Internet, perhaps
          to be further developed, perhaps one day adopted, or
          perhaps forgotten, by the future.
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          It claims to apply the idea of common ancestry to
          biological nomenclature, so as to complete the
          Darwinian Revolution -- the overthrow of alleged
          essentialism and typological thinking of Linnaean
          systematics and its nomenclature.
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          It claims that Linnaean nomenclature, whether botanical
          or zoological, is defective enough so as to be
          insufficient for modern needs.
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          It claims that Phylocode is fully sufficient for modern
          needs, achieved by abolishing ranks and binomial
          nomenclature, and by adopting a certain distinction
          between the ideas of definition and diagnosis.  The
          distinction leads to an original proposal about types
          and their function.
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          These claims stem from herpetological research done in
          California during the 1980s primarily by graduate
          students Kevin de Queiroz and Jacques Gauthier, at San
          Diego State and UC Berkeley.  Kevin is currently a
          curator at the US National Museum, and Jacques a
          Professor at Yale University.
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          These claims, or slogans, have been repeated enough in
          recent years to cause discussion and to provoke
          criticism.
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          I begin with criticism.
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          First from Norman Platnick during an NSF workshop on
          systematic monographs, for the benefit of students,
          held at the US National Museum about a year ago.
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          Let me read some of Norman's words:
        </p>
        <p class="Cite">
          "Now one thing I've learned from 30 years of watching
          biologists is that whenever you find one systematist
          calling another one an essentialist or a typologist,
          you can be 100% sure that the name-caller is purely,
          simply, and entirely, wrong, and is just creating a
          smokescreen to cover his or her tracks.  In this case,
          those tracks rank about as high on the SIP scale as any
          I've encountered; the SIP scale, incidentially,
          measures the levels of sanctimony, inflation, and
          pomposity.  Rest assured, these authors truly believe
          that their proposals have already created (and here
          again I quote), 'a new era in biological taxonomy' (de
          Queiroz & Gauthier, 1990:312).  That one brave new
          world I'd choose to slide from!"
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          Next a review paper published last year in Cladistics
          by the botanist Kevin Nixon and the entomologist James
          Carpenter.  They contested all the claims of Phylocode.
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          They are most unsettled by the:
        </p>
        <p class="Cite">
          "condescending tone toward the vast bulk of
          taxonomists."
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          And the implication that
        </p>
        <p class="Cite">
          "Taxonomists have been largely unaware of Aristotelian
          perspective on definitions."
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          Next a paper published last year in Biological Reviews
          by Michael Benton, a vertebrate paleontologist from the
          UK. 
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          I'll pass to the last sentence, which refers to
          Linnaean nomenclature:
        </p>
        <p class="Cite">
          "if it ain't broke, don't fix it."
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          Next, a botanical symposium, a few months ago at the US
          National Museum: 
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          Linnaean Taxonomy in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century.
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          And a contribution from Peter Forey, fish
          paleontologist from the British Museum.
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          The title tells it all: 
        </p>
        <p class="Cite">
          "Phylocode -- Pain No Gain"
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          From Platnick to Forey, spiders and fossil fishes;
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          Nixon & Carpenter, plants and wasps;
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          Benton, fossil tetrapods;
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          There is commonality of perspective and of criticism
          damaging to Phylocode -- enough perhaps to leave it
          dead on the vine.
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          Finally, some contributed comment [to the Bot. Symp.].
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          From Quentin Wheeler, the eloquent entomologist:
        </p>
        <p class="Cite">
          "Linnaean nomenclature is stable enough to say what we
          know, flexible enough to accommodate what we learn;
          independent of specific theory, yet reflective of known
          empirical data; compatible with phylogenetic theory,
          but not a slave to it; particular enough for precise
          communication, general enough to reflect refuted
          hypotheses.  LN is an effective international,
          inter-generational, and trans-theoretical system of
          classification that was forged and tested by those
          describing the earth's biota, not touting political
          slogans.  It has weathered more worthy adversaries than
          the Phylocode and will be in wide use long after the
          latter is a curious footnote to the history of
          taxonomy."
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          I turn now to the distinction, fundamental to
          Phylocode, between Definition and Diagnosis.
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          This appears in the Master's Degree of Kevin de
          Queiroz, San Diego State, Fall 1985 -- a thesis on
          bones of iguanas, Richard Etheridge supervisor:
        </p>
        <p class="Cite">
          "For each taxon I include: 1) the type on which the
          taxon is based, 2) the etymology of the name, 3) a
          phylogenetic definition (Gauthier et al 1986), 4) a
          diagnosis consisting of hypothesized synapomorphies, 5)
          the current distribution, 6) fossil records 7) various
          comments."
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          The reference to Gauthier et al. is to a paper
          subsequently published in a memorial volume to Charles
          Camp, on the subject of phylogenetic relationships
          among lizard families.
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          Kevin begins with the subfamily Iguaninae, with the
          definition: 
        </p>
        <p class="Cite">
          "The most recent common ancestor of Brachylophus,
          Dipsosaurus, and [the tribe] Iguanini, and all of its
          descendants."
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          There are some 30 species in the subfamily.  The
          relationships of these New World lizards are shown
          here, a figure from the Camp volume.
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          Remember the definition:
        </p>
        <p class="Cite">
          "The most recent common ancestor of Brachylophus,
          Dipsosaurus, and [the tribe] Iguanini, and all its
          descendants."
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          I recall William K Gregory, of the American Museum two
          generations before me.  He received a PhD from Columbia
          University in 1907.  He said that, traditionally, there
          are two ways to define, diagnose, describe, or
          differentiate a taxon -- as if the difference between
          the two ways were between tweedle-dum and tweedle-dee: 
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          1:   To make a list of its characters. 
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          2:  To make a list of its members -- its subtaxa:
        </p>
        <p class="Cite">
          Brachylophus, Dipsosaurus, and [the tribe] Iguanini.
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          Anyway, in the Gauthier et al. paper in the Camp volume
          one reads:
        </p>
        <p class="Cite">
          "The above criterion also has the virtue of clearly
          distinguishing between the definition of a taxon and
          its diagnosis.
        </p>
        <p class="Cite">
          Taxa that are defined by characters possessed by their
          members are typological concepts.
        </p>
        <p class="Cite">
          By defining taxa in terms of ancestry, as we have done,
          such taxa will be truly phylogenetic concepts (de
          Queiroz, 1988).
        </p>
        <p class="Cite">
          Characters, which enable us to recognize taxa, are used
          to diagnose taxa in phylogenetic taxonomies, but they
          cannot define them."
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          Does the reference to "the most recent common ancestor"
          add anything to Gregory's simple list of subtaxa? --
          Brachylophus, Dipsosaurus, and [the tribe] Iguanini? 
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          The question can be argued, but I don't argue it here.
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          Instead, let me tell you about my friend Charlie.
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          We went fishing in the ocean the other day, caught lots
          of big ones, and as they were hauled aboard a few
          remoras dropped off onto the boat deck.
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          Up to a meter long, r&eacute;moras, or rem&oacute;ras
          if you like,
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          lack a spinous dorsal fin.  In its place is a sucking
          disk on top of the head, permitting the fish to attach
          to, and ride along with, larger animals -- billfishes,
          sharks, whales, turtles, even boats and ships -- as
          they move through the water.
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          Charlie sorted through the remoras on the deck and
          exclaimed:
        </p>
        <p class="Cite">
          "There are eight different species here -- all that are
          known in the world.  There's <i>Remora brachyptera,
          Echeneis naucrates</i>, <i>Phtheirichtys
          lineatus</i>&hellip;."
        </p>
        <p class="Cite">
          "That's nice, Charlie," I said.  "This must be the
          first time in history that they were all collected
          together."
        </p>
        <p class="Cite">
          "I've been thinking," he said, "how fish families
          should each have a phylogenetic definition, like in the
          Phylocode.  I'm gonna give one for the remora family."
        </p>
        <p class="Cite">
          "That's nice Charlie," I asked, "how do you do
          <i>that</i>?"
        </p>
        <p class="Cite">
          "Oh, it's easy.  Anybody can do it.  You don't have to
          know a thing."
        </p>
        <p class="Cite">
          "That's nice Charlie, but how can <i>that</i> be true?"
        </p>
        <p class="Cite">
          "I'll show you," he said. 
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          He selected one specimen of each of the eight species,
          put them into an array like this one, took a picture
          with his digital camera, and, in a loud voice and
          pointing to the eight specimens on the deck, said:
        </p>
        <p class="Cite">
          "The most recent common ancestor of these eight fishes,
          and all its descendants."
        </p>
        <p class="Cite">
          "Charlie, what <i>are</i> you on about?"
        </p>
        <p class="Cite">
          "Oh," he said, "with a phylogenetic definition the
          family becomes really meaningful.  Before, it was only
          an empty abstraction in the mind."
        </p>
        <p class="Cite">
          "And now, Charlie?"
        </p>
        <p class="Cite">
          "Now?  Well, the old family had just one type, the
          genus <i>Echeneis</i>.  That's typology and
          essentialism. 
        </p>
        <p class="Cite">
          The new family, well it won't be called a family, will
          have eight types, well they won't be called types. 
          Now, that's evolution and population thinking.  It'll
          have a new name, too, I never liked <i>Echeneis</i>. 
          It sounds like an echinoderm."
        </p>
        <p class="Cite">
          "Tell me, Charlie, do you <i>often</i> do this sort of
          thing?"
        </p>
        <p class="Cite">
          "Oh yes, I have done it for many of the 500 fish
          families of the world.  I have them in a database in my
          computer -- with pictures, too, representing all the
          new type taxa -- at least two per family, but often
          more.  The more types, the more precision and meaning. 
          I can hardly wait to add the remoras.  It's all on my
          website.  When I've done the families I'm gonna do the
          genera and species -- really pin down those 60,000
          names.  Or change 'em, when I want.  Easy-peasy, now
          that we have a complete catalog of fish genera and
          species in the old system."
        </p>
        <p class="Cite">
          "And each family, Charlie, once it has a common
          ancestor in its definition, does it really become more
          meaningful?"
        </p>
        <p class="Cite">
          "Oh yes, each and every one, but I don't call them
          families.  That's too old-fashioned.  None of my
          friends knows what the family means any more.  And they
          don't like typology.  Even the word type sends them up
          the wall."

        <p class="Cite">

        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          Arthur Cain's thoughts on Linnaeus were apparently
          inspired by Ernst Mayr, himself apparently inspired by
          Karl Popper.
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          This is a complex matter, as is most philosophy.  Let
          me say only that, with respect to Linnaeus and Linnaean
          classification, it forms a miserable history of
          depreciatory comment without a particle of truth.
        </p>
        <p class="Abstract">
          In sum, Phylocode is hungry for attention.  It is
          stuffed with slogans.  It is otherwise without meaning.
