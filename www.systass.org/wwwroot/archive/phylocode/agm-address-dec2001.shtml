<p class="title">Systematics Association, 2001 annual address - Dr. Norman Platnick</p>

<p>On Wednesday 5 December, Dr. Norman Platnick gave the Annual 
Address to the Systematics Association AGM.  The address was given in the lecture room of the Linnean Society of London.</p>

<H2>From Cladograms to Classifications: The Road to DePhylocode</H2>

<H2>Norman I. Platnick</H2>
<H3>Division of Invertebrate Zoology, American Museum of Natural History, 
Central Park West at 79th Street, New York NY 10024 USA</H3>

<P>I'd like to begin with a bit of personal history, since that 
seems to be the easiest way to get into the subject.  Back in the 
middle ages, or at least the middling decades of the last century, 
when I was a grad student studying spiders in the green pastures of 
Harvard University, our catechism was supplied by Ernst Mayr and his 
"New Systematics" (or, as I prefer to call it, the "Non Systematics").  
In retrospect, I should have known that something was amiss from day 
one.  There I was, unpacking my stuff into the tiny cubicle I was 
assigned on the fourth floor of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, 
when a distinguished-looking gentleman strolled in, and asked a few 
questions about who I was, what I was interested in, what my thesis 
was going to be about, and the like.  I was scheduled to take an 
evolution course that first semester, which was to be team-taught by 
Ernst Mayr, erstwhile malacologist Steve Gould, and lepidopterist John 
Burns.  The assigned textbook, of course, was to be Mayr's "Animal 
Species and Evolution," so I had a copy of it out on my desk.  My 
visitor pointed to the book and said "Oh, I see you've got a copy of 
the bible."  That seemed like a very strange comment, indeed; hailing, 
as I did, from the fundamentalist bible-belt of the Appalachian 
mountains, I wasn't exactly used to hearing evolutionary texts 
referred to as biblical, in any sense!  So I just shrugged the comment 
off, and went on with the conversation.  After a while, my guest stood 
up, shook hands, said "Oh, by the way, I'm Ernst Mayr," and strode 
out.</P>

<P>Be that as it may, I was soon properly indoctrinated.  
Species, I was told, are real, and what every right-thinking 
organismic biologist should focus on, to the exclusion of all else, 
because groups of species -- higher taxa -- are not real, but merely 
human and artificial constructs.</P>

<P>Now, I have to say that I never found that position to be very 
sensible.  I could look around at my major professor, for example, an 
arachnologist by the name of Herb Levi.  His mentor had been the long-
time spider curator at the American Museum, a true seat-of-the-pants 
taxonomist named Willis Gertsch.  By this time, however, on at least a 
few occasions, Levi had published a revision of a group, and Gertsch 
had felt compelled to write a rebuttal.  Levi was then having to 
publish papers attempting to explain why some of his species were, at 
least according to Gertsch and other highly respected colleagues, just 
artificial assemblages of several different and easily distinguished 
species that weren't even necessarily each other's closest relatives.  
Yet, despite all these disputes about species, none of these eminent 
systematists seemed to have any difficulty whatever in agreeing on at 
least some higher taxa, such as spiders.</P>

<P>Indeed, spiders seemed, then and now, to be the quintessential 
example of a natural, or real group, so real that I thought it was 
utterly impossible for anyone to make a mistake about whether a given 
organism is or is not a spider.  Now, I do have to stop and be honest 
here; what I actually thought was utterly impossible was for anyone 
other than a paleontologist to make that mistake.  As usual, of 
course, I was wrong on that count, too.  A few years back I had to co-
author a paper on Brucharachne, the spider that wasn't -- a spider, 
that is.  In 1925, as it transpires, one of the worst taxonomists 
South America ever produced, the immortal Candido Firmino de Mello-
Leitao, actually described a whole new family of spiders, based on 
what turned out to be a single male mite (Krantz and Platnick, 1995).</P>

<P>But I bring all this history up mostly to point out that we 
have now made our way fully to the opposite pole on the rather 
fundamental issue of taxa and their reality, with papers appearing in 
the journal Systematic Biology about so-called "phylogenetic taxonomy" 
and bidding "a farewell to species."  In other words, some of our 
colleagues are now arguing exactly the opposite point of view from the 
"non systematics" I was taught as a grad student; they are arguing 
that higher taxa are real but species, somehow, are not.  At least one 
author, Fred Pleijel, adopts "a view where species simply are denied 
any role in taxonomy and where only monophyletic groups are recognized 
by formal Latin names" and he says he applies "uninomials for all 
names, because this treatment does not recognize any species entities 
and applies the same nomenclature for all taxa" (Pleijel, 1999: 756).
As you might guess, I personally consider both of these polar 
positions to be preposterous, wrong-headed, and insidious.  Let's 
proceed by getting rid of the obvious.  I assume we all recognize that 
species, and groups of species, are first of all hypotheses, and in 
that sense only, represent artificial constructs of the human mind.  
But I assume we all recognize that it is possible, at least in theory, 
for one of those hypotheses to be an accurate statement about the real 
world.  Who knows, on a good day, maybe even more than one of our 
hypotheses might be accurate!</P>

<P>Throughout the centuries since Clerck (and here you have to 
forgive me, for spider systematics, in its typically precocious 
fashion -- and with all due respect to our august surroundings -- 
starts with Clerck in 1757, rather than that late-comer Linnaeus, in 
1758), most systematists have avowedly been seeking natural 
classifications, by which they meant classifications that consist of 
species, and groups of them, that actually exist in the real world.
And I would suggest that this is an entirely appropriate goal.  
After all, how do we know that anything, such as the chair you're 
snoozing in, actually exists?  The answer, of course, is that we can 
keep bumping into it -- lots of different sources of evidence agree.  
So lets look at a putatively natural group like spiders, and ask 
whether we have evidence that it is real.</P>

<P>Spiders have at least two characters that are completely 
universal within the group, and completely unknown outside the group.  
The most obvious character is the abdominal spinerets through which 
silk is emitted.  But there is another unique character, namely that 
adult males have modified structures on the tips of their pedipalps 
that are used to transfer sperm to the females during copulation.  In 
a male spider, there is no anatomical connection between the gonads 
and the intromittent organ; the male spider has to deposit a drop of 
sperm from his abdomen, and then dip his palps into the sperm to 
charge them for mating.</P>

<P>To date, systematists have described some 1.75 million 
species, and of those, some 37,600 species are currently considered 
valid members of the Order Araneae, the spiders.  If we pick abdominal 
spinnerets as a character, that feature allows us to group 37,600 
species, and no others, as spiders.  If we then group together those 
species with male pedipalps modified for sperm transfer, we are once 
again grouping together a mere 37,600 out of 1.75 million species.  
For those of you interested in statistics, imagine that you were asked 
to draw 37,600 species from a pool of 1.75 million, and then to repeat 
that procedure.  What would be the probability of picking exactly the 
same set of 37,600 species, the second time, by chance alone?  In 
fact, that probability is so infinitesimally small that in this case 
no real statistician would need Joe Felsenstein's preferred three 
characters to conclude that spiders, as a group, are one of the best 
corroborated hypotheses around.</P>

<P>So I suggest that at least some of the groups in our current 
classifications are real, natural, or monophyletic -- choose whichever 
adjective you prefer, since the choice actually makes no difference 
whatever to anything important.  No one would claim that all our 
groups are real, but I would hope that we can all agree that basically 
we would like our classifications to consist entirely of groups like 
spiders -- groups based on the congruence of different sources of 
evidence.</P>

<P>The same is true, of course, for species, but that is actually 
a somewhat tougher tune to carry, simply because there is such a 
diversity of species concepts.  The amount of literature devoted to 
species concepts is astonishingly large, and all I can do here is to 
outline my own prejudices, so that you have a basis for evaluating my 
conclusions, and how they relate to the reality of species as well as 
groups.  For, unlike the Non Systematists and their modern mirror 
images, I contend that both species and groups of them are, or at 
least can be, real.</P>

<P>There is a book produced by Columbia University Press, edited 
by Quentin Wheeler and Rudolph Meier (2000), called "Species Concepts 
and Phylogenetic Theory: A Debate,"  which I usually recommend as a 
good place to get oriented to this chunk of the literature.  The book 
represents a debate among five different species concepts, with the 
papers organized into three sections.  In the first section, 
proponents of each concept get a chapter to outline their views.  In 
the second section, each of the proponents gets a chapter to indicate 
what they think is wrong with each of the competing presentations, and 
in the third section, each of the proponents gets a chapter to respond 
to the criticisms made of their views.</P>

<P>That book provides us with at least a start on a taxonomy of 
species concepts.  Some workers have enumerated several dozens of 
different species concepts, but most of those are just trivial 
variants of others, and the classification in the Wheeler and Meier 
book will amply serve my purposes.  Here is the layout:</P>

</TABLE>

<P>First is the so-called biological species concept.  Of course, this 
concept is actually no more or less biological than any of its 
competitors, so I call it the interbreeding concept.  It dates back to 
the 1930's and views actual or potential interbreeding as the 
touchstone of species.  Originally propounded by the vertebrate 
zoologists of the Non Systematics movement, this concept never won 
much favor with botanists, and since it doesn't apply at all to 
asexually reproducing organisms, it is unquestionably unfit as a 
general concept for systematics.  And, of course, we now recognize 
that within any particular monophyletic group, retention of the 
ability to interbreed is a plesiomorphic character, and hence not a 
phylogenetically acceptable basis for classification.</P>

<P>The Hennigian concept, dating back to the 1960's, is a 
definite improvement, viewing species as internodes -- those units set 
off by successive speciation events (or in some cases a speciation 
event plus a later extinction event).  This takes care of the 
interbreeding as plesiomorphy problem.  According to this view, 
however, ancestral or stem species cannot survive speciation events; 
they cease to exist even if one of their descendant species happens to 
be identical in all known characteristics.  Any such actual example 
would clearly represent a case of theory triumphing over data, hardly 
an elegant solution to anything.</P>

<P>The real phylogenetic species concept, dating back to the late 
1970's, regards species as the smallest diagnosable samples of self-
perpetuating organisms.  It differs from another concept sometimes 
also called phylogenetic, the autapomorphic species concept, in 
differentiating between species and higher taxa, in that regard.  
Putative higher taxa, under the real phylogenetic species concept, 
must be evidenced by autapomorphic characters, but species are not 
required to have an autapomorphy, merely a unique combination of 
characters.  In other words, species must be diagnosable, not 
necessarily autapomorphic.</P>

<P>You might think that the difference between diagnosable and 
autapomorphic is insignificant, but consider one conceivable mode of 
speciation, in which a tiny peripheral population of a widespread 
species becomes isolated and eventually speciates.  The peripheral 
isolate presumably has to develop at least one autapomorphy, in order 
to be recognized as different from the original species.  If it is 
possible for that to happen without the widespread population also 
acquiring a new autapomorphy, then the "mother" population cannot 
remain a species under the autapomorphic species concept, because it 
no longer has any apomorphies not also shared by the peripheral 
species.  Personally, I would argue that if the species we 
systematists hypothesize are to be useful to other evolutionary 
biologists, and most particularly to those biologists investigating 
speciation mechanisms, then they must be agnostic with regard to modes 
of speciation -- they cannot rule out some potential modes of 
speciation, such as peripheral budding, simply by theoretical fiat.  
Hence, to me, the autapomorphic species concept is simply 
unacceptable.</P>

<P>Finally, there is the so-called evolutionary species concept, 
which dates back to Simpson rather than Mayr.  Here again, it is no 
more or less evolutionary than any other concept, and I call it the 
historical roles concept.  Proponents like Wiley say that an 
evolutionary species is "an entity composed of organisms that 
maintains its identity from other such entities through time and over 
space, and which has its own independent evolutionary fate and 
historical tendencies."  Since I don't know how to determine the 
evolutionary fate or historical tendencies of any of my spider 
species, I don't have much use for this mysticism.</P>

<P>Interestingly, though, at least four of the five concepts seem 
to view species as real, just as real as higher taxa.  Peculiarly, it 
is the one concept that treats species and higher taxa identically 
that has spawned some latter-day relunctance to view species as real!  
Bizarre, isn't it?  I realize that not all the proponents of the 
autapomorphic species concept take this approach to its logical 
conclusion, but it is only under this concept that views like 
Pleijel's could even surface.  Of course, for me, that's just another 
reason to consider the autapomorphic species concept guilty, as 
charged.  But that still leaves us with the question of how best to 
reflect real taxa in our classifications.</P>

<P>Back in the early days of the cladistics wars, it was 
fashionable in some circles to see classification as a serious problem 
for phylogeneticists.  The problem, of course, was imaginary.  As we 
all now recognize, cladistic analysis gave us the tools to discover 
that some groups, such as spiders, are natural, or putatively 
monophyletic, and that other groups, such an invertebrates or 
reptiles, are not.  Cladists, of course, argued that only monophyletic 
groups should be included in classifications, and their opponents 
argued that this creates an overly complex system with too many groups 
being named.  That, of course, was merely a canard.  No monographer 
is, or ever was, forced to name any groups that they don't (or didn't) 
find it useful to name.  All that phylogenetics requires is that no 
groups be named that are hypothesized to be non-monophyletic.</P>

<P>For example, I recently published a monograph of the spider 
family Lamponidae (Platnick, 2000), in which I recognized three 
subfamilies, each of which is monophyletic according to the cladistic 
analysis carried out in the monograph.  It is true that one of those 
subfamilies represents the sister group of the other two, but I chose 
not to apply a formal name to the latter group.  If someone else 
wishes to, that's fine, but my classification is fully phylogenetic, 
as it includes only putatively monophyletic groups.  There are even 
conventions proposed, such as phyletic sequencing, where the order in 
which taxa are listed in a formal classification provides information 
about the branching pattern, without requiring additional names.</P>  


<P>There are other conventions proposed, such as plesions, that can help 
cope with the problems encountered in trying to include fossil 
fragments in formal classifications as well.</P>

<P>But the basic point is simple:  the Linnaean hierarchy is 
inherently pre-adapted to presenting cladistic information, for the 
hierarchy can mirror a cladogram in as much, or as little, detail as 
one would like.  There are even conventions proposed for generating 
lots of categorical ranks for such purposes, for those favoring 
maximal amounts of detail.  And if you don't like extra named ranks, 
you can always use a system like that recently suggested by Papavero, 
Llorente-Bousquets, and Abe (2001), in which you just add a suffix, 
like -1 or +2, to an existing group name to indicate that you're 
talking about a group one or two nodes above or below the named one.</P>

<P>It is very strange, therefore, that some systematists have 
begun to argue that we need to abandon the Linnaean hierarchy 
entirely.  You can often recognize these folks easily enough; they're 
the ones wandering around in t-shirts that read "Phyla Schmyla" (which 
is apparently a lapsus or mere printer's error; the shirts were 
actually supposed to have read "Yale Schmale").  And, of course, these 
are the same folks now promoting the so-called Phylocode (Cantino and 
de Queiroz, 2000) as the cure to all our woes.</P>

<P>It seems that there are at least two motivations behind this 
movement, which I'm ashamed to say was originated by two 
herpetologists from the U.S., Kevin De Queiroz and Jacques Gauthier.  
One motivation, seemingly, is just to find some way to salvage non-
monophyletic groups like Reptilia and Dinosauria, so that 
herpetologists are not inconvenienced by increased understanding of 
amniote interrelationships.  But the real motivation, and I'll quote 
from De Queiroz & Gauthier (1990: 320), is that:</P>

<P class="quote"><EM>"if the Darwinian Revolution is ever to occur in biological taxonomy 
... then the role of the principle of descent must change ... from an 
after-the-fact interpretation to a central tenet from which the 
principles and methods of taxonomy are deduced. ... Previously, taxa 
were considered to be defined by characters and only interpreted 
after-the-fact as products of evolution."</EM></P>

<P>In the benighted view of these authors, most if not all 
previous systematists have been ignorant or misled essentialists or 
typologists who have been so stupid as to use character-based 
definitions or diagnoses of taxa.  Now one thing I've learned from 30 
years of watching biologists is that whenever you find one systematist 
calling another one an essentialist or a typologist, you can be 100% 
sure that the name-caller is purely, simply, and entirely, wrong, and 
is just creating a smokescreen to cover his or her tracks.  In this 
case, there are a lot of tracks to cover, and they rank about as high 
on the SIP scale as any I've encountered; the SIP scale, incidentally, 
measures the levels of sanctimony, inflation, and pomposity.  Rest 
assured, these authors truly believe that their proposals have already 
created (and here again I quote), a "new era in biological taxonomy" 
(de Queiroz & Gauthier, 1990: 312).  That's one brave new world I'd 
choose to slide from!</P>

<P>The complaints of these workers about the non-evolutionary 
basis of the existing system are entirely specious and unconvincing 
exercises in metaphysics, and are not worthy of serious attention.  
Let's look instead at what they suggest is an improved system, which 
they argue will do a better job of promoting explicitness, 
universality, and stability of names, as now encapsulated in the draft 
Phylocode.  To accomplish this goal, they wish to define the names of 
taxa in terms of common ancestry, rather than characters.  My 
colleagues Kevin Nixon and Jim Carpenter (2000) have therefore 
referred to this view as the node-pointing or NP system.  Now that's a 
highly unfortunate choice of terms, since NP is a fine pair of 
initials that doesn't deserve to be sullied in such fashion; even my 
wife's initials are NP, which I guess makes us an NP-complete family.  
I'll call it the NB (or node-based) system instead, since that is the 
phrase actually used by de Queiroz and Gauthier themselves, and "N.B." 
has all the appropriate connotations.  Those authors and their fans 
have repeatedly (i.e., de Queiroz and Gautheir, 1990, 1992, 1994, and 
ad nauseum ever since) illustrated:</P>

<P>Three classes of phylogenetic definitions</P>

<ol class="indent">

<li style="margin-bottom: 1em">A node-based definition is used to define the name of a clade 
stemming from the most recent common ancestor of two specified 
organisms, species or clades (e.g. Aves = the clade stemming from the 
most recent common ancestor of Struthio camelus and Passer 
domesticus).<br><br>
[Of course, in the real world, you and I both realize that De Queiroz 
and Gauthier don't actually have any knowledge whatsoever about the 
most recent common ancestor of those two species; like us, they 
actually know only the characters that happen to optimize at the node 
of their preferred cladogram that happens to subtend those two taxa.]</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 1em">A stem-based definition is used to define the name of a clade of 
all species sharing a more recent common ancestor with one specific 
organism, species or clade than with another (e.g. Lepidosauromorpha = 
Lepidosauria and all species sharing a more recent common ancestor 
with Lepidosauria than with Archosauria).</li>

<li>An apomorphy-based definition is used to define the name of a 
clade stemming from the first ancestor to evolve a specified character 
(e.g. Tetrapodomorpha = the clade stemming from the first vertebrate 
to evolve pentadactyl limbs). (de Queiroz and Gauthier, 1994: 29).</li>

</ol>

<P>Of course, these are all old ideas, thoroughly discussed by Hennig and 
others in the context of fossil fragments, stem groups, crown groups, 
and the like.  A favorite example of these authors is the lizard 
family Agamidae, and here again, I'll quote:</P>

<P class="quote">"For example, the name 'Agamidae' might be defined as the clade 
stemming from the most-recent common ancestor of Agama and Leiolepis.  
Such a definition is thoroughly evolutionary in that the concept of 
common ancestry is fundamental to the meaning of the name" (de Queiroz 
and Gauthier, 1994: 29).</P>

<P>As if the definition could possibly be one wit less evolutionary if it 
concerned itself with the evidence from which those author's 
conclusions about common ancestry were drawn (after-the-fact)!  The 
reason they like this example is that the Agamidae is another one of 
those groups, like Reptilia, that recent research suggests may be 
artificial.  As their figure indicates, although these largely Old 
World lizards were formerly divided into two separate families, the 
Agamidae and Chamaeleonidae, some agamids may actually be closer to 
chameleons than to other agamids.  To them, this is apparently a 
tragedy.  An ordinary systematist would ask first, where on the 
cladogram the type genus of the Agamidae happens to fall, and would 
then choose a solution that conveys the phylogenetic information 
accurately while doing the least possible damage to existing concepts.</P>  

<P>Probably the easiest solution would be to restrict Agamidae to the 
group including Agama and supply a new family-group name for the 
remaining taxa previously misplaced in the Agamidae.  Alternatively, 
all three clades could be lumped into a single family, a solution de 
Queiroz and Gauthier dislike because the name Chameleonidae happens to 
have priority over Agamidae.</P>

<P>But de Queiroz and Gauthier are slippery as salamanders here, 
and elsewhere.  Although they suggested that Agamidae might be defined 
as "the clade stemming from the most-recent common ancestor of [just 
two taxa] Agama and Leiolepis" they have also supplied a figure (and 
other examples) in which six and three, respectively, descendent taxa 
are used to point to nodes.  Apparently, their view is that the more 
ambiguous our knowledge of relationships is, the more taxa should be 
used to point to a given node.  As Nixon and Carpenter have shown, 
however, the choice of taxa can have major effects on the stability of 
the name involved.</P>

<P>But ultimately, the question is what, exactly, it is that 
remains stable.  In their lizard example, they suggest that:</P>

<P class="quote">"Under phylogenetic definitions, 'Chamaeleonidae" retains its 
association with the clade stemming from the most recent common 
ancestor of the species represented by filled circles, and 'Agamidae' 
retains its association with the clade stemming from the most recent 
common ancestor of the species represented by open circles, although 
the chamaeleonid species are now also thought to have descended from 
this ancestor.  The manner in which the definitions are stated ensures 
that no names designate paraphyletic taxa, and neither splitting nor 
lumping occurs, but hierarchical relationships may be altered (e.g., 
Chamaeleonidae is now judged to be nested within Agamidae)."</P>

<P>As the last comment shows, what has actually been achieved, by 
abandoning Linnaean ranks and categories, as they advocate, is merely 
stability of spelling.  Here is the Linnaean classification before the 
altered concepts of relationship:</P>

<p class="example">Family Agamidae, containing taxa ABCDEF<BR>
Family Chamaeleonidae, containing taxa GHI</p>

<P>This Linnean classification accurately reflects the traditional view 
of the interrelationships of these taxa, under which taxa A, B, and C 
form the sister group of D, E, and F, with taxa G, H, and I 
representing the sister group of A-F together.  What matters, here, 
however, is not that particular cladogram.  What matters is that from 
the information in these two lines:</P>

<p class="example">Family Agamidae, containing taxa ABCDEF<br>
Family Chamaeleonidae, containing taxa GHI,</p>

<P>and that information alone, any systematist can deduce a whole series 
of three-taxon statements of relationship, all of which must be true 
if the classification is true:  (AB)G, (AB)H, (AB)I, (AC)G, etc. -- if 
I've counted correctly, there are actually 63 such three-taxon 
statements that follow from this classification.  Such inferences are 
possible solely because of the use of Linnaean categories:  the 
classification asserts that taxa A-F are not chamaeleonids, and that 
taxa G-I are not agamids, and it is precisely those prohibitions that 
allow the detailed hypotheses about relationships.  As Popper (1959) 
has shown, it is also precisely by making prohibitions that hypotheses 
become testable and hence scientific.<P>

<P>Contrast that with the de Queiroz and Gauthier solution, which 
looks like this:<P>

<p class="example">[unranked group] Agamidae, containing taxa ABCDEFGHI<br>
[unranked subgroup] Chamaeleonidae, containing taxa GHI</p>

<p>From this classification, one can deduce only 18 three-taxon 
statements:  (GH)A, (GH)B, etc.  They have indeed kept the spelling 
stable, but at the cost of reducing the information content of the 
classification by about 75%!  And the name Agamidae, although still 
spelled the same, now refers to a different group (A-I rather than A-
F).  Imagine what would happen if, for example, it turned out that 
instead of being most closely related to crocodiles, birds are most 
closely related to chameleons.  We would now have a node-based 
definition in which Agamidae would still persist as the spelling of a 
name, but would now refer to a group including both lizards and birds!  
It would be hard to imagine a case that would better fit Gene 
Gaffney's quip that stability equals ignorance.</P>

<P>According to de Queiroz and Gauthier, "a name should not designate 
different taxa [I guess they mean, unless the name is Agamidae], nor a 
taxon be designated by different names, at different times."  By that 
standard, it is difficult to see any benefit whatever to node-based 
nomenclature.  Of the two original group names, one now designates 
different taxa, and information content has been strangled.  If 
instead we opt for:</P>

<p class="example">Agamidae, containing taxa ABC<br>
DEFidae, containing DEF<br>
Chamaeleonidae, containing GHI</p>

<P>(i.e., a conventional Linnaean classification, albeit one implying 
nothing more than a basal trichotomy among these three families), 
again one name now designates different taxa, but information content 
decreases only to 54 three-taxon statements, rather than 18.</P>

<P>If instead we opt for the more resolved, fully subordinated 
classification:</P>

<p class="example">Chamaeleonoidea, containing taxa ABCDEFGHI<br>
    Agamidae, containing taxa ABC<br>
    Chamaeleonidae, containging taxa DEFGHI<br>
        DEFinae, containing DEF<br>
        Chamaeleoninae, containing GHI</p>

<P>two names now designate different taxa (although one of them also 
remains accurate, with just a slight change in spelling) but 
information content zooms, to 81 implied three-taxon statements.  In 
this particular case, the phyletic sequencing option actually seems 
optimal, for if our earlier arrangement:</P>

<p class="example">Agamidae, containing taxa ABC<br>

DEFidae, containing taxa DEF<br>
Chamaeleonidae, containing taxa GHI</p>

<P>is considered as sequenced, we can retrieve the full branching 
pattern, and hence all 81 implied three-taxon statements, while 
changing the meaning of only one name.<P>

<P>If you are unhappy with implied three-taxon statements as a 
measure of information content, then try other measures; based on the 
comparisons by Mickevich and Platnick (1989), the results are unlikely 
to differ significantly.  But consider for a moment what 
classification is all about.  Is stability the primary goal of 
classification?  Of course not!  The primary goal of classification is 
and always has been maximal predictive power.  Cladists have long 
argued that phylogenetic classifications are both the best summaries 
of the limited character information already available, and the best 
basis for making predictions about the much larger universe of as yet 
unstudied characters.  Taxonomists are in the business of providing 
highly predictive classifications on the basis on extremely small 
amounts of data, and our track record of success, over the last two 
and a half centuries, is none too shabby.  Every three-taxon statement 
that a classification implies represents a prediction that whatever 
future synapomorphies might be found, in any character system 
whatever, may fit the pattern (A & B as opposed to)C but will not fit 
the two conflicting patterns (A & C as opposed to)B or (B & C as 
opposed to)A.  Again, scientific classifications prohibit things.</P>

<P>In contrast, the NB system achieves stability in spelling only, and 
often at great expense in terms of sacrificed information content and 
predictive power.  Ultimately, no NB system can possibly produce a 
more predictive classification than would a fully informative, 
completely subordinated, sequenced, or otherwise conventioned Linnaean 
hierarchy based on the same cladogram.  In other words, there is no 
possible potential gain in predictive power to be achieved by 
switching to an NB system, and many possible potential losses of that 
power.</P>

<P>In short, it would indeed be rational to consider abandoning 
the Linnaean hierarchy, if by so doing we could achieve 
classifications with greater information content and increased 
predictive power.  In my opinion, however, abandoning the Linnaean 
hierarchy in order to achieve stability in spelling accompanied by 
instability in meaning, frequently decreased information content, and 
frequently decreased predictive power is simply not rational.  As a 
goal, stability in spelling seems dubious, at best; is this approach 
most stably spelled i-n-s-a-n-e, or merely i-n-a-n-e?</P>

<P>Let me close with one final example, involving (of course) 
spiders.  I was wandering around John Murphy's garden out in Hampton, 
and came across a nice jumping spider.  Now, jumping spiders, the 
family Salticidae, are probably the easiest of all spider families to 
recognize.  With their large anterior median eyes, their excellent 
vision, the often highly exuberant and ornamented morphology that 
males use in their elaborate courtship displays, and their prowess at 
jumping on prey several body-lengths away, salticids are quite 
distinctive.  Probably the vertebrate analog would be best exemplified 
in Archie Carr's Subjective Key to the Fishes of Alachua County, 
Florida, in which the first couplet reads "Any damn fool knows a 
catfish."  The botanical analog might be the mints, which may be the 
only plant family duffers like me can manage to recognize 
successfully, wherever we roam!</P>

<P>A fair chunk of my time over the past 15 years has been spent 
on The World Spider Catalog (Platnick, 2001), which is now easily 
accesible via the aptly-named World Wide Web.  The catalog provides a 
listing of all the currently valid spider species, all the other names 
that have ever been applied to them in the past, and all the citations 
to every important taxonomic treatment ever published on every one of 
those species.  To my knowledge, the only thing like it currently 
available for any other sizable group of organisms is Bill Eschmyer's 
catalog of the fishes.  If you visit the site, you'll find a summary 
table that shows, for each of the 109 currently recognized spider 
families, the numbers of currently valid genera and species, 
including, at the very end of the list, the salticids, with 4,834 
species.</P>

<P>Using the Linnaean hierarchy, when I identified the spider in 
John's garden as a salticid, I was asserting that John's spider is 
more closely related to any single species currently included within 
the Salticidae than it is to any single species that is currently 
excluded from that family.  In other words, if my identification, and 
the current classification, are both correct, then John's spider is 
more closely related to salticid species #1 than it is to any of the 
32,752 spider species currently excluded from the Salticidae.  It is 
also more closely related to salticid species #2 than it is to any 
non-salticid spider.  So, assuming that the spider from John's garden 
belongs to one of the currently known 4,834 salticid species (and this 
being England, that's certainly a fair assumption), then my 
identification enables 4833 (other salticids) times 32,752 (non-
salticids) three-taxon statements.  So by placing the animal as a 
salticid, the current Linnaean hierarchy allows me to make 158,290,416 
three-taxon statements about it, within spiders alone.  If I were to 
expand the arena to include all arthropods, or all life, the number of 
implied three-taxon statements would, for all practical purposes, 
approach one-third of infinity -- the other two-thirds would be 
prohibited.  That's none too shabby, for a single word -- Salticidae 
(admittedly, in a context provided -- solely -- by the Linnaean 
hierarchy, and the mutual exclusivity of equally ranked names it 
requires).</P>

<P>Contrast that with an identical list of names that happen to 
end in "idae," and the numbers of genera and species they contain, but 
now under the assumption that the NB system is in use.  Salticidae 
still refers to a group, that is still presumably monophyletic, but 
one can no longer infer anything about the status of the species 
included in other groups.  Thus, for example, even the first family on 
that list, the Liphistiidae, could in fact, in the current 
classification, be just a subgroup of the Salticidae.  The fact that 
both names end in "idae" -- in the NB system -- does not prevent 
either group from being a subgroup of the other.  Now, in fact, 
calling John's spider a salticid does not allow me to make even a 
single three-taxon statement involving any other species.  I can't say 
that it must be more closely related to another salticid than to a 
liphistiid, because Liphistiidae might in fact constitute the sister-
taxon of John's species, for all I know (or, more accurately, for all 
the names in an NB system could ever let me know; unlike an NB 
systematist, I do actually know better than that!).</P>

<P>So, let's see, we have John's salticid and either the Linnaean 
hierarchy, with 158 million predictions about spiders alone, or the NB 
system, with no useful predictions at all.  The Linnaean system, with 
built-in exclusivity that forces classifications to prohibit things 
and thereby become scientific hypotheses, or the NB system, in which 
classifications prohibit nothing and names, by themselves, become mere 
propaganda, like the Phylocode itself.  Gee, life is full of tough 
choices, isn't it?</P>
