<p class="title">the Phylocode debate</p>

<p>"Phylocode debate -- Mike Lee (for); Gary Nelson (against)"
held during the Joint Conference of the Australasian Evolution Society
and the Society of Australian Systematic Biologists, 16-18 July
2001, University of Melbourne."</p>

<p><strong>an unpublished talk reproduced with the permission of Gary Nelson</strong></p>

<p>Phylocode claims to be a new and alternative system of
nomenclature for botany and zoology.</p>

<p>It exists as a draft document on the Internet, perhaps to be
further developed, perhaps one day adopted, or perhaps forgotten,
by the future.</p>

<p>It claims to apply the idea of common ancestry to biological
nomenclature, so as to complete the Darwinian Revolution -- the
overthrow of alleged essentialism and typological thinking of
Linnaean systematics and its nomenclature.</p>

<p>It claims that Linnaean nomenclature, whether botanical or
zoological, is defective enough so as to be insufficient for
modern needs.</p>

<p>It claims that Phylocode is fully sufficient for modern needs,
achieved by abolishing ranks and binomial nomenclature, and by
adopting a certain distinction between the ideas of definition
and diagnosis.  The distinction leads to an original proposal
about types and their function.</p>

<p>These claims stem from herpetological research done in
California during the 1980s primarily by graduate students Kevin
de Queiroz and Jacques Gauthier, at San Diego State and UC
Berkeley.  Kevin is currently a curator at the US National
Museum, and Jacques a Professor at Yale University.</p>

<p>These claims, or slogans, have been repeated enough in recent
years to cause discussion and to provoke criticism.</p>

<p>I begin with criticism.</p>

<p>First from Norman Platnick during an NSF workshop on
systematic monographs, for the benefit of students, held at the
US National Museum about a year ago.</p>

<p>Let me read some of Norman's words:</p>

<p class="Cite">"Now one thing I've learned from 30 years of watching
biologists is that whenever you find one systematist calling
another one an essentialist or a typologist, you can be 100% sure
that the name-caller is purely, simply, and entirely, wrong, and
is just creating a smokescreen to cover his or her tracks.  In
this case, those tracks rank about as high on the SIP scale as
any I've encountered; the SIP scale, incidentially, measures the
levels of sanctimony, inflation, and pomposity.  Rest assured,
these authors truly believe that their proposals have already
created (and here again I quote), 'a new era in biological
taxonomy' (de Queiroz & Gauthier, 1990:312).  That one brave
new world I'd choose to slide from!"</p>

<p>Next a review paper published last year in Cladistics by the
botanist Kevin Nixon and the entomologist James Carpenter.  They
contested all the claims of Phylocode.</p>

<p>They are most unsettled by the:</p>

<p class="Cite">"condescending tone toward the vast bulk of taxonomists."</p>

<p>And the implication that</p>

<p class="Cite">"Taxonomists have been largely unaware of Aristotelian
perspective on definitions."</p>

<p>Next a paper published last year in Biological Reviews by
Michael Benton, a vertebrate paleontologist from the UK. </p>

<p>I'll pass to the last sentence, which refers to Linnaean
nomenclature:</p>

<p class="Cite">"if it ain't broke, don't fix it."</p>

<p>Next, a botanical symposium, a few months ago at the US
National Museum: </p>

<p>Linnaean Taxonomy in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century.</p>

<p>And a contribution from Peter Forey, fish paleontologist from
the British Museum.</p>

<p>The title tells it all: </p>

<p class="Cite">"Phylocode -- Pain No Gain"</p>

<p>From Platnick to Forey, spiders and fossil fishes;</p>

<p>Nixon & Carpenter, plants and wasps;</p>

<p>Benton, fossil tetrapods;</p>

<p>There is commonality of perspective and of criticism damaging
to Phylocode -- enough perhaps to leave it dead on the vine.</p>

<p>Finally, some contributed comment [to the Bot. Symp.].</p>

<p>From Quentin Wheeler, the eloquent entomologist:</p>

<p class="Cite">"Linnaean nomenclature is stable enough to say what we know,
flexible enough to accommodate what we learn; independent of
specific theory, yet reflective of known empirical data;
compatible with phylogenetic theory, but not a slave to it;
particular enough for precise communication, general enough to
reflect refuted hypotheses.  LN is an effective international,
inter-generational, and trans-theoretical system of
classification that was forged and tested by those describing the
earth's biota, not touting political slogans.  It has weathered
more worthy adversaries than the Phylocode and will be in wide
use long after the latter is a curious footnote to the history of
taxonomy."</p>

<p>I turn now to the distinction, fundamental to Phylocode,
between Definition and Diagnosis.</p>

<p>This appears in the Master's Degree of Kevin de Queiroz, San
Diego State, Fall 1985 -- a thesis on bones of iguanas, Richard
Etheridge supervisor:</p>

<p class="Cite">"For each taxon I include: 1) the type on which the taxon is
based, 2) the etymology of the name, 3) a phylogenetic definition
(Gauthier et al 1986), 4) a diagnosis consisting of hypothesized
synapomorphies, 5) the current distribution, 6) fossil records 7)
various comments."</p>

<p>The reference to Gauthier et al. is to a paper subsequently
published in a memorial volume to Charles Camp, on the subject of
phylogenetic relationships among lizard families.</p>

<p>Kevin begins with the subfamily Iguaninae, with the
definition: </p>

<p class="Cite">"The most recent common ancestor of Brachylophus, Dipsosaurus,
and [the tribe] Iguanini, and all of its descendants."</p>

<p>There are some 30 species in the subfamily.  The relationships
of these New World lizards are shown here, a figure from the Camp
volume.</p>

<p>Remember the definition:</p>

<p class="Cite">"The most recent common ancestor of Brachylophus, Dipsosaurus,
and [the tribe] Iguanini, and all its descendants."</p>

<p>I recall William K Gregory, of the American Museum two
generations before me.  He received a PhD from Columbia
University in 1907.  He said that, traditionally, there are two
ways to define, diagnose, describe, or differentiate a taxon --
as if the difference between the two ways were between
tweedle-dum and tweedle-dee: </p>

<p>1:   To make a list of its characters. </p>

<p>2:  To make a list of its members -- its subtaxa:</p>

<p class="Cite">Brachylophus, Dipsosaurus, and [the tribe] Iguanini.</p>

<p>Anyway, in the Gauthier et al. paper in the Camp volume one
reads:</p>

<p class="Cite">"The above criterion also has the virtue of clearly
distinguishing between the definition of a taxon and its
diagnosis.</p>

<p class="Cite">Taxa that are defined by characters possessed by their members
are typological concepts.</p>

<p class="Cite">By defining taxa in terms of ancestry, as we have done, such
taxa will be truly phylogenetic concepts (de Queiroz, 1988).</p>

<p class="Cite">Characters, which enable us to recognize taxa, are used to
diagnose taxa in phylogenetic taxonomies, but they cannot define
them."</p>

<p>Does the reference to "the most recent common ancestor" add
anything to Gregory's simple list of subtaxa? -- Brachylophus,
Dipsosaurus, and [the tribe] Iguanini? </p>

<p>The question can be argued, but I don't argue it here.</p>

<p>Instead, let me tell you about my friend Charlie.</p>

<p>We went fishing in the ocean the other day, caught lots of big
ones, and as they were hauled aboard a few remoras dropped off
onto the boat deck.</p>

<p>Up to a meter long, rémoras, or remóras if you
like,</p>

<p>lack a spinous dorsal fin.  In its place is a sucking disk on
top of the head, permitting the fish to attach to, and ride along
with, larger animals -- billfishes, sharks, whales, turtles, even
boats and ships -- as they move through the water.</p>

<p>Charlie sorted through the remoras on the deck and
exclaimed:</p>

<p class="Cite">"There are eight different species here -- all that are known
in the world.  There's <i>Remora brachyptera, Echeneis
naucrates</i>, <i>Phtheirichtys lineatus</i>."</p>

<p class="Cite">"That's nice, Charlie," I said.  "This must be the first time
in history that they were all collected together."</p>

<p class="Cite">"I've been thinking," he said, "how fish families should each
have a phylogenetic definition, like in the Phylocode.  I'm gonna
give one for the remora family."</p>

<p class="Cite">"That's nice Charlie," I asked, "how do you do <i>
that</i>?"</p>

<p class="Cite">"Oh, it's easy.  Anybody can do it.  You don't have to know a
thing."</p>

<p class="Cite">"That's nice Charlie, but how can <i>that</i> be true?"</p>

<p class="Cite">"I'll show you," he said. </p>

<p>He selected one specimen of each of the eight species, put
them into an array like this one, took a picture with his digital
camera, and, in a loud voice and pointing to the eight specimens
on the deck, said:</p>

<p class="Cite">"The most recent common ancestor of these eight fishes, and
all its descendants."</p>

<p class="Cite">"Charlie, what <i>are</i> you on about?"</p>

<p class="Cite">"Oh," he said, "with a phylogenetic definition the family
becomes really meaningful.  Before, it was only an empty
abstraction in the mind."</p>

<p class="Cite">"And now, Charlie?"</p>

<p class="Cite">"Now?  Well, the old family had just one type, the genus <i>
Echeneis</i>.  That's typology and essentialism. </p>

<p class="Cite">The new family, well it won't be called a family, will have
eight types, well they won't be called types.  Now, that's
evolution and population thinking.  It'll have a new name, too, I
never liked <i>Echeneis</i>.  It sounds like an echinoderm."</p>

<p class="Cite">"Tell me, Charlie, do you <i>often</i> do this sort of
thing?"</p>

<p class="Cite">"Oh yes, I have done it for many of the 500 fish families of
the world.  I have them in a database in my computer -- with
pictures, too, representing all the new type taxa -- at least two
per family, but often more.  The more types, the more precision
and meaning.  I can hardly wait to add the remoras.  It's all on
my website.  When I've done the families I'm gonna do the genera
and species -- really pin down those 60,000 names.  Or change
'em, when I want.  Easy-peasy, now that we have a complete
catalog of fish genera and species in the old system."</p>

<p class="Cite">"And each family, Charlie, once it has a common ancestor in
its definition, does it really become more meaningful?"</p>

<p class="Cite">"Oh yes, each and every one, but I don't call them families. 
That's too old-fashioned.  None of my friends knows what the
family means any more.  And they don't like typology.  Even the
word type sends them up the wall."</p>

<p class="Cite">"Charlie, what about this common ancestor that seems so
important to the definition?"</p>

<p class="Cite">"Oh, that's just an imaginary fish."</p>

<p class="Cite">"Charlie, these imaginary fishes, one for each family, how do
you tell which one belongs to the remoras?"</p>

<p class="Cite">"Oh, that's easy," he said, "it's the imaginary fish with a
disk on top of its head."</p>

<p class="Cite">"Charlie, do you have a picture of that, too?"</p>

<p class="Cite">"Not yet, but I'm working on a program to generate ancestral
images.  It'll soon be ready.  I'm gonna copyright 'em.  I'll
make a bundle."</p>

<p>So much for Charlie.</p>

<p>A Phylocode slogan:</p>

<p class="Cite">"The use of phylogenetic definitions liberates biological
taxonomy from a 2,000-year-old tradition of basing the
definitions of taxon names on characters" (<b>de Queiroz &
Gauthier 1990, <i>Syst. Zool</i>. 39:310).</b></p>

<p>We are left with the distinction between definition and
diagnosis. </p>

<p>Is the distinction anything more than verbal?</p>

<p>The distinction between organism and character. </p>

<p>Between the remora and its disk.</p>

<p>Between the whole organism and one of its parts, which one
might, in this case, carve off with a knife.</p>

<p>I won't argue that question either.</p>

<p>The reference to de Queiroz (1988) is to a paper submitted in
1986, about the time he entered UC Berkeley as a PhD student. 
Here some themes of Phylocode can be found.</p>

<p>Here one reads about</p>

<p class="Cite">"the delay of the Darwinian Revolution in biological
taxonomy"</p>

<p>and</p>

<p class="Cite">"a general framework for a truly phylogenetic
systematics."</p>

<p>Acknowledged is a "tremendous intellectual debt" to various
persons philosophically inclined: Graham Griffiths, Michael
Ghiselin, David Hull.</p>

<p>In the conclusion one reads:</p>

<p class="Cite">"Perhaps this approach will ultimately lead to the replacement
of the Linnaean taxonomic system (Griffiths 1976).  In short,
embracing a truly evolutionary systematics will result in drastic
taxonomic changes; this is why we talk about a Darwinian
Revolution."</p>

<p>Pardon me, but I can't help remembering one of the old boys of
the past, another fish paleontologist from the British Museum, in
a presidential address to the Linnean Society, not so long
ago:</p>

<p class="Cite">"We shall certainly not advance matters by jumping up and down
shrilling, 'Darwin is god and I, so-and-so, am his prophet." --
Errol White, Proceedings of the Linnean Society of London 177:8
(1966).</p>

<p>Do these words apply?</p>

<p>Are they proved wrong?</p>

<p>Jacques Gauthier, PhD in Paleontology, UC Berkely, 1984, friend
and colleague for 25 years.  It is said that Berkeley was the
only American University with a separate Department of
Paleontology -- not any more, now, in this age of
amalgamation.</p>

<p>This diagram, from Jacques' thesis, shows birds -- Aves -- and
some of their fossil relatives according to him, beginning with
<i>Archaeopteryx</i>, and from right to left continuing with a
series of fossil groups from the Mesozoic:</p>

<p class="Cite">Deinonychosauria,</p>

<p class="Cite">Orthomimidae,</p>

<p class="Cite">Carnosauria,</p>

<p class="Cite">Ceratosauria,</p>

<p class="Cite">Sauropodomorpha,</p>

<p class="Cite">Ornithischia,</p>

<p class="Cite">Herrarasauridae.</p>

<p>Jacques  named some of the nodes basal to birds -- Aves, using
existing terms, from vertebrate paleontology, such as</p>

<p class="Cite">Coelurosauria,</p>

<p class="Cite">Theropoda,</p>

<p class="Cite">Saurischia and</p>

<p class="Cite">Dinosauria --</p>

<p>extinct groups found by him to be paraphyletic -- similar
to</p>

<p class="Cite">Invertebrata,</p>

<p class="Cite">Apes,</p>

<p class="Cite">Plants,</p>

<p class="Cite">Gymnosperms,</p>

<p class="Cite">Barbarians.</p>

<p>In Jacques' usage, the terms apply to living birds, which in
addition to being birds, become</p>

<p class="Cite">Caelurosaurians,</p>

<p class="Cite">Theropodans,</p>

<p class="Cite">Saurischians, and finally</p>

<p class="Cite">Dinosaurs.</p>

<p>In Jacques' usage all of these become names of taxa that are
said to be not extinct because they include living birds.</p>

<p>Yes, with wordplay of the kind, birds become dinosaurs. </p>

<p>The hocus-pocus seemed to lend Phylocode significance as a
rationale for naming nodes of the kind, when perhaps the nodes
are best left unnamed in such a way, so that <i>Archaeopteryx</i>
and other such feathered creatures, recently discovered as
Mesozoic fossils, can be considered birds in the technical sense
of systematics as well as in their biology.</p>

<p>I won't argue this matter.  Rather, let me just give the
alternative view, from yet another fish paleontologist of the
British Museum.</p>

<p class="Cite">"In the 150 years since Richard Owen names Dinosauria for a
few bones of <i>Iguanodon</i>, <i>Megalosaurus</i> and <i>
Hylaeosaurus</i>, the result of the efforts of palaeontologists
has been to discover what dinosaurs are, not what birds are. 
Perhaps surprisingly, dinosaurs turn out to be kinds of bird, a
theory of relationships that is most clearly and economically
expressed by including them within Aves.  Colin Patterson, <i>
Department of Palaeontology, The Natural History Museum</i>."</p>

<p class="Cite">"Are Birds Really Dinosaurs?"</p>

<p>Yes, says the average paleontologist, according to DinoBuzz
from UC Berkeley.</p>

<p>There are several other questions that have the same general
import, for example:</p>

<p class="Cite">Are Fishes Really -- Invertebrates?</p>

<p class="Cite">Are Humans really -- Apes?</p>

<p class="Cite">Are Animals Really -- Plants?</p>

<p class="Cite">Are Angiosperms really -- Gymnosperms?</p>

<p class="Cite">Are Greeks really -- Barbarians?</p>

<p class="Cite">And so on.  The list is endless.</p>

<p>When the paraphyletic group is extinct, the question is
portrayed as meaningful, at least by the average paleontologist. 
Shame on him!</p>

<p>The meaning lies solely in publicity generated for the media. 
Birds might be related to some dinosaurs more closely than to
others.  This does not mean that birds are dinosaurs or that
birds evolved from dinosaurs.</p>

<p>Slogan:</p>

<p class="Cite">"The concept of common ancestry is fundamental to the meaning
of the names."</p>

<p>Fundamental to Phylocode is common ancestry.  How is this
conceived?</p>

<p>So far as I can tell it is an imaginary species, organism,
zygote, or spore -- take your pick as the occasion demands.</p>

<p>Its vagueness notwithstanding, the concept is seen as
crucial.</p>

<p>Descent from a common ancestral organism -- an Eve or Adam or
both?  For taxa generally -- a natural order, genus, or species
-- Linnaeus had the same view.  For him, each natural order,
genus, and species comprises the offspring of a single organism,
or if the sexes are separate, from an original pair.</p>

<p>Phylocodists dismiss Linnaeus as an essentialist, typologist,
Aristotelian.  Think about it.  Theirs is an essentialist
approach to history -- as if the historical Linnaeus has an
essence or type, The Aristotelian, which is to be vanquished so
that The King Be Dead, Long Live the King.</p>

<p>Much of the Phylocode appears in a paper of 1992 in the Annual
Review of Ecology and Sstematics.</p>

<p>Here we have more comment on the history of systematics:</p>

<p class="Cite">"The principle of descent did not become a central tenet from
which taxonomic principles and methods were derived (111,
115)."</p>

<p>I don't have to tell you who are the authors of the
publications cited.</p>

<p>In the conclusions we read that:</p>

<p class="Cite">"biological taxonomy must eventually outgrow the Linnaean
system, for that system derives from an inappropriate theoretical
context.  Modern comparative biology requires a taxonomic system
based on evolutionary principle."</p>

<p>What is one to conclude? -- except that Phylocode is
ideologically driven -- by postmodern hokum.</p>

<p>In the acknowledgements, we learn that herpetologist Richard
Etheridge, supervisor of Kevin's Master's Thesis and now Emeritus
at San Diego State, is at the root of this sorry history.</p>

<p>So there is another lesson, perhaps, to be learned:</p>

<p>To be careful with idle remarks to impressionable youth, lest
he, or she, be inspired to "reform biological nomenclature,' so
as to become, as it were, a second Linnaeus in the memory of the
future.</p>

<p>This is the Phylocode document now available on the
Internet:</p>

<p align="center"><b>PhyloCode: A Phylogenetic Code of Biological
Nomenclature</b></p>

<p>Among this list of notables, there is no ichthyologist nor
entomologist, even though these persons in North America are not
in sort supply.  I am sure that they are not deliberately
excluded.   Their absence is noteworthy.</p>

<p>Phylocode is not yet operational.  It remains to be adopted,
imposed, or left to wither on the vine.</p>

<p>The phylocode is to progress through Registration:</p>

<p class="Cite">"In order for a name to be established under the PhyloCode,
the name and other required information must be submitted to the
PhyloCode registration database."</p>

<p>'Tis a bit o' madness to expect delivery of such for 60,000
fish taxa, as if doing so would serve a real purpose.</p>

<p>But, then, Charlie has a lot of energy and, apparently these
days, nothing else to do.</p>

<p>It was recently written:</p>

<p class="Cite">"Espousing 'laws,' Linnaeus wanted to transform botany from an
ungovernable living language with a multitude of provincial
dialects, into a legislated code administered from a single
centre."</p>

<p>                   Lisbet Koerner, 1999</p>

<p>                   Linnaeus: Nature and Nation</p>

<p>This is from Lisbet Koerner's 1999 biography of Linnaeus,
published by Harvard -- another PhD thesis.</p>

<p>One may doubt that Linnaeus -- or anyone until very recently
-- ever had such ambition.  Regardless, it was never achieved
during Linnaeus' lifetime or at any time since.  Biological
nomenclature, nevertheless, evolved into the state described
above, accurately I think, by the Eloquent Entomologist, Quentin
Wheeler.</p>

<p>Phylocode aspires to achieve a legislated code administered
from a single centre.  Is this the legacy of Linnaeus?</p>

<p>As reinforcing background to Phylocode there is a body of
philosophical literature.  A recent example is Ereshefsky's book
on Poverty.</p>

<p class="Cite">"The Poverty of the Linnaean Hierarchy:   A Philosophical
Study of Biological Taxonomy.  Marc Ereshefsky.  Cambridge
University Press. 2001."</p>

<p>The literature, generated by just a few persons forms a
connected whole.</p>

<p>An early contribution is David Hull's paper on
essentialism:</p>

<p class="Cite">"The Effect of Essentialism on Taxonomy -- Two Thousand Years
of Stasis."</p>

<p>David quotes Karl Popper:</p>

<p class="Cite">"every discipline as long as it used the Aristotelian method
of definition has remained arrested in a state of empty verbiage
and barren scholasticism."</p>

<p>I've known David Hull for a long time.</p>

<p>He hates Karl Popper and always has.  He never believed a word
that Popper ever published.</p>

<p>David also cites an earlier piece by Arthur Cain, one of a
series by this early English pheneticist, now deceased.</p>

<p>Arthur Cain's thoughts on Linnaeus were apparently inspired by
Ernst Mayr, himself apparently inspired by Karl Popper.</p>

<p>This is a complex matter, as is most philosophy.  Let me say
only that, with respect to Linnaeus and Linnaean classification,
it forms a miserable history of depreciatory comment without a
particle of truth.</p>

<p>In sum, Phylocode is hungry for attention.  It is stuffed with
slogans.  It is otherwise without meaning.</p>
