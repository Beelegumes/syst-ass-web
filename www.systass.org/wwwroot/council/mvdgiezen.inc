Mark's primary research interest is the evolution of early microbial eukaryotes and 
their mitochondria. The origin of eukaryotes appears closely linked to that of the 
mitochondrion (or its anaerobic sister, the hydrogenosome), and by studying the diversity 
of mitochondria in various microbial eukaryotes he hopes to shed light on some key 
early events in eukaryote evolution.
