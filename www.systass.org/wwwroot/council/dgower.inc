David is a collections-based vertebrate biologist working on the natural history 
of amphibians and reptiles.  Much of his work is taxonomic and phylogenetic, for 
which he draws on a wide range of evidence (morphology, molecules, fossils).  Current 
focal taxa are caecilian amphibians, burrowing and aquatic snakes, and Triassic 
archosaurian reptiles.
