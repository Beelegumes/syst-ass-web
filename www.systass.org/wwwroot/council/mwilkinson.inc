Mark is a Researcher at the Natural History Museum, London focussing on systematics and evolution.
Mark combines field and lab-based empirical work on caecilians (mainly tropical, snake-like amphibians)
with more theoretical work in phylogenetics including issues in character construction,
effects of missing data, and the development and evaluation of consensus and supertree methods.
