James works in the Kew Conservation Genetics group utilising genetic and genomic datasets to inform conservation projects. The population level research projects can be divided into two main geographical groups and they are 1) UK overseas territories 2) UK based projects in collaboration with Dr Mike Fay. These activities use microsatellite markers and RADseq (restriction site associated DNA markers) to elucidate population structure. James also has interests in phylogenetic relationships in Guarea (Meliaceae) and in polyploidy in Nicotiana (Solanaceae).
