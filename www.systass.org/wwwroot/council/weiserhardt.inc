Wolf is a plant systematist at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. While his favourite study group are the palms (Arecaceae), he works on a range of taxa using phylogenomics approaches. He is interested both in species-level phylogenetics of specific groups and higher-level relationships across plants. He also has a strong interest in plant ecology and biogeography, and bringing phylogenetic data to bear on questions of those disciplines. Thus, he is keen to promote a better integration of systematics with its sister disciplines within biodiversity science.
