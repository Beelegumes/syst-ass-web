Karen is a Marie Curie Postdoctoral Fellow working at the University of Aberystwyth and Leeds University. Her work combines field work, molecular biology, genomics and bioinformatics. She is a Peruvian herpetologist with extensive experience of barcoding techniques for assessing cryptic amphibian species, discovering novel species and analysing the diversity and conservation status of Peruvian amphibians and reptiles. Her PhD studies, conducted in Ireland, addressed methodological approaches to large-scale phylogenetic reconstructions. Her current postdoctoral work investigates the molecular basis behind the ability of poison arrow frogs to sequester toxins from their diet at the molecular level using transcriptomic and phylogenomic approaches
