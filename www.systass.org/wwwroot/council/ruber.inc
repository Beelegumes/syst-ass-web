Lukas' research is motivated by a keen interest in the astonishing diversity of ray-fined 
fishes and the patterns of diversity and the evolutionary processes generating it. He is 
particularly interested in the application of genetic and geometric morphometric data to 
study the evolution of ecological and phenotypic diversity within species rich lineages. 
Additional research interests include: biogeography, comparative methods applied to 
life-history evolution, ancestral character state reconstruction, and relaxed molecular 
clock methods. His current research focuses on Southeast Asian freshwater fish diversity, 
marine adaptive radiations, and speciation in Lake Tanganyika cichlids.
