            The Systematics Association is committed to
            furthering all aspects of Systematic biology. It
            organises a vigorous programme of international
            conferences on key themes in systematics, including a
            series of major biennial conferences launched in
            1997. The association also supports a variety of
            training courses in systematics and awards grants in
            support of systematics research. <a href=

<!--<p><span style="background-color: #cc6633;">The 2016/17 round of the Systematics Research Fund is now closed.</span></p>-->

<!--<p>The Councils of the Linnean Society of London and the Systematics Association
jointly administer the Systematic Research Fund.  Typical activities supported
include contributions to fieldwork expenditure, the purchase of scientific
equipment or expertise (e.g. buying time on analytical equipment), specimen
preparation (including the cost of temporary technical assistance), and
contributions to publication costs (although we are unable to support article
processing charges). Projects of a more general or educational nature will also
be considered, provided that they include a strong systematics component. Typical
activities not supported include attendance at scientific meetings and contributions
to student maintenance or tuition fees. The fund does not provide payments for Bench
Fees. Projects already substantially funded by other bodies may be disadvantaged.
Applications of all nationalities are welcome but applicants must be a member of
the Systematics Association or Linnean Society of London.</p>

<p>Successful projects are selected by a panel of systematists who represent a wide
range of conceptual interests and taxonomic groups. The value of any single award
will not exceed &pound;1500.<br><br>
