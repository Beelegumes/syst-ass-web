Aoife is a Senior Editor of Molecular Biology and Evoution, and is on the editorial board of Genome Biology and Evolution and Cell Reports, she was Treasurer of the Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution for three years, and receives frequent invitations to speak at major international conferences and participate in the organisation of international meetings.

<p class="title">Abstract:</p>

<p>Human copy number variants (CNVs) account for genome variation an order of magnitude larger than single nucleotide polymorphisms. While much of this variation has no phenotypic consequences, some variants have been associated with disease, particularly neurodevelopmental disorders.  Pathogenic CNVs are typically very large and contain multiple genes, and understanding the cause of the pathogenicity and identifying candidate disease genes remains a significant challenge. We take an approach that uses evolutionary patterns across the vertebrate tree to infer functional constraints on gene duplication and/or loss.  We identify evolutionary constraints  characteristic of genes in pathogenic CNVs and that can only be explained by dosage sensitivity of those genes.  These evolutionary metrics suggest a path to identifying disease genes in pathogenic CNVs.</p>
