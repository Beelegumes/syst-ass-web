<p class="title">The earliest tetrapods: What were they, and what are they?</p>

<p>When E.S. Goodrich coined the term tetrapod, meaning a vertebrate with four legs
(or whose ancestors had them), there was a clear distinction between them and
anything that might have been called a 'fish'. Only extant animals were considered at
that time, because the fossil record of intermediate forms was more or less nonexistent.
Recent work on the earliest limbed vertebrates, from the Late Devonian
period about 375-360 million years ago, has blurred the distinction between 'fish' and
'tetrapods' as applied to fossil forms. We now know much more about the transition
between these body forms from a wealth of discoveries over the last 15 or 20 years.
But this has brought problems of definition. What is a tetrapod, or rather how is the
group Tetrapoda defined? This, and emergent associated questions are highly
controversial. This talk will introduce some of the creatures that have been
discovered, and the different, incompatible views that have been put forward as
answers.</p>
