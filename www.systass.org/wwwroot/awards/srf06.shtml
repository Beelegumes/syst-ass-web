          The Councils of the <a href="http://www.linnean.org/"
          rel="external">Linnean Society</a> and the Systematics
          Association jointly administer the SRF fund.
        </p>
        <p>
          Applications of all nationalities are welcome, and
          <strong>need not be members of either the Systematics
          Association or the Linnean Society of London.</strong>
          Please note that <strong>only</strong> electronic
          applications made using the form below are acceptable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Typical activities supported include contributions to
          fieldwork expenditure, the purchase of scientific
          equipment or expertise (e.g. buying time on analytical
          equipment), specimen preparation (including the cost of
          temporary technical assistance), and contributions to
          publication costs. Projects of a more general or
          educational nature will also be considered, provided
          that they include a strong systematics component.
          Typical activities not supported include attendance at
          scientific meetings and contribtuions to student
          maintenance or tuition fees. The fund does not provide
          payments for Bench Fees. Projects already substantially
          funded by other bodies may be disadvantaged.
        </p>
        <p>
          Successful projects are selected by a panel of six
          systematists who represent a wide range of conceptual
          interests and taxonomic groups. The value of any single
          award will not exceed &pound;1500.
        </p>
        <p>
          Applications may be submitted after 1 October but must
          be received before the 31 December of the same year, to
          be eligible for funds approved in the following
          calendar year. Decisions will be posted March-April of
          the year subsequent to submission.
