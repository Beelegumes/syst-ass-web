          We live in an age of ubiquitous genomics. Next generation sequencing (NGS) technology,
          both widely adopted today and advancing at pace, has transformed todayâ€™s data landscape,
          opening up an enormous source of heritable characters to the comparative biologist.
          Its impact on systematics, like many other fields of biology, has been felt throughout
          its breadth: from defining species boundaries to estimating their evolutionary histories.
        </p>
        <p class="textsmall"> This volume examines the broad range of ways in which NGS data are
          being used in systematics and in the fields that it underpins, from biodiversity prospecting
          to evo-devo. The authors draw on contemporary case studies to demonstrate state- of-the-art
          applications of NGS data. These, along with novel analyses, comprehensive reviews and lively
          perspectives are combined to produce an authoritative account of contemporary issues in
          systematics that have been advanced and impacted by the recent adoption of NGS.

          In partnership with our new publisher, Cambridge
          University Press, The Systematics Association offers
          great opportunities for authors and editors seeking to
          publish their work. If you have an idea for a themed
          multiauthor volume (not necessarily based on a
          symposium) or a textbook, and would like this to be
          produced at high quality and promoted by both the
          Association and CUP, then please contact the
