<p>RESPONSE OF THE SYSTEMATICS ASSOCIATION TO THE HOUSE OF
LORDS: - SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY IN THE UK</p>

<p>22 January 2002.  Below is the final version of the Associations response to the House of 
Lords request for evidence for their enquiry on 'Systematic Biology 
and Biodiversity in the UK'.</p>  

<p>1. Systematic Biology is a fundamental science that
underpins all other areas of biological research, and its survival as a scientific
discipline in the UK is therefore vital. We welcome this review and recommend
an urgent overhaul of funding to promote taxonomic expertise in the UK.</p>

<p>2. The Systematics Association believes that considerable
changes have been made in the organisation of Systematic Biology since 1992,
and several major funding initiatives (NERC’s Taxonomy Initiative, Darwin
Initiative, Wellcome Biodiversity Fellowships) have allowed Taxonomy to make
important advances, especially in some aspects of molecular Systematics and
bioinformatics.</p>

<p>3. However all these funding initiatives have been
short-term and patchy in their coverage, and have failed totally to provide the
basis for a sustainable maintenance of wide-ranging taxonomic expertise across
the UK. Even more disastrously,
research in whole-organism identification, the fundamental core of Systematics,
has become virtually impossible to fund, and its teaching has all but
disappeared in Universities.</p>

<p>4. The UK Research Councils do not currently fund Systematic
Biology <i>per se</i>, wrongly believing this
to be the province of major government-funded institutions rather than
universities. There is a misconception
that molecular and computer techniques alone can be maintained in isolation
from core expertise in whole-organism identification (i.e. alpha-taxonomy).  The ‘hypothesis-driven?focus of UK Research
Councils does occasionally allow for the development of a Systematics related
methodology, but funding the application of such techniques is virtually
impossible. </p>

<p>5. Current funding levels for Systematic Biology are
unsustainable; the UK cannot now support the work needed to implement current
and future policies on biodiversity. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a
coherent funding policy for UK Systematics. Without such a development, UK expertise
in many areas of Systematic Biology will have disappeared within the next two
decades. Research in whole-organism diagnostics (alpha taxonomy), has already almost disappeared from
Universities.</p>

<p>6. The UK needs to provide comprehensive education and
career prospects in Systematics.  Training in Systematics awareness should start in schools, and be
developed by modules taught throughout the Higher Education system to explain
the fundamental role of Systematics.  A
viable career structure must be available for post-graduates, which is
currently lacking. The Systematics
Association works with many excellent young Ph.D. students (via our conference
bursaries, training courses etc.), there is a high demand for places on MSc training
course (e.g. NHM and Imperial College), and our post-graduate textbook
describing taxonomic methods is a best-seller.  There is clearly no shortage of interest in Systematics among young UK
scientists; we clearly need them, but the problem is in finding them suitable
permanent positions once they have graduated.</p>

<p>7. During the review period, the Systematics Association has
contributed a significant proportion of its resources to a number of
initiatives designed to promote Systematic Biology both within and outwith the
UK. These include awarding small grants and awards for taxonomic research,
establishing an annual Young Systematists Forum, and awarding bursaries to
allow young and recently graduated taxonomists to attend our highly successful
and international Biennial Symposium, a conference designed to provide a forum
for UK systematists and publicise the role of Systematics to a wider
audience.</p>

<p>8. The large number of high-quality applications for our
small grant schemes reflects a demand for funds and recognition from the
Systematics community.  However, these
important but limited measures can neither meet existing demands nor attract or
retain young researchers into what remains an exciting but inadequately
resourced field.</p>

<p>9. The Systematics Association is urgently fostering links
with international bodies, both in Europe and the USA.  One example is PEET, a recent US
(NSF-funded) initiative to promote taxonomic expertise in the USA, which would
be a good model for a similar development within the UK. The President of the
Systematics Association will therefore participate in the 2002 PEET meeting; we
also propose to encourage and fund attendance by a senior UK Research Council
administrator.  The UK is in danger of
losing its international standing in Systematics, and other countries are doing
much more to combat this universal problem.</p>

<p>10. Our main recommendation is that a central funding body
must be set up for UK Systematics, and it should be in a position to develop
and fund a strategy that will ensure that all branches of Systematics survive
and develop. The body should also draw
up a clear statement of the range and scope of Systematics research, and
explore international collaboration with Europe, with North America, and with
developing countries lacking a taxonomic infrastructure.</p>

<p>11. Recent developments in the field of e-Science should be
actively developed as a method of making taxonomic data more widely
available. Thereby it will help provide
the framework for a sustainable systematics research infrastructure in the
UK. This should include biodiversity
data (i.e. databases including species lists, checklists, keys, maps and
inventories), character state information (i.e. descriptions of species in
monographs and regional accounts), and techniques (for example, an online
version of our techniques textbook).  To
achieve this, e-Science must include a programme of acquiring and transforming
non-digital data (i.e. in papers and monographs) which are currently not easily
accessible. E-Science is an important
enabling technology for Systematic Biology, but cannot be effective without a
diverse body of well-funded taxonomists. </p>
