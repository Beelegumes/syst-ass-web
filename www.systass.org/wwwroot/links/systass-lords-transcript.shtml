Association and the Linnean Society Examination of
Witnesses</b></p>

<p><b>PROFESSOR CHRIS HUMPHRIES, President of the Systematics
Association</b></p>

<p><b>SIR DAVID SMITH, President of the Linnean Society,
examined.</b></p>

<p align="center"><b>Chairman</b></p>

<p>76. Good morning Professor Humphries and good morning Sir
David. Welcome to our sub-committee. Thank you very much indeed
for giving us evidence this morning. Thank you, also, for the
written evidence that you have provided for us. Perhaps I could
kick off this morning by telling you that evidence to us has
suggested that it is alpha-taxonomy that has suffered in
particular over the last ten years. Perhaps I could ask you both,
would you agree with this and are there any groups that have
suffered in particular? Are they of particular significance and
importance, in terms of either the UK or the CBD or any other
treaty? Professor Humphries, would you like to start with that
one?</p>

<p><i>(Professor Humphries)</i> I would like to say that for the
last 20 years or so there has been a real decline in many areas;
cutbacks in alpha-taxonomy have occurred in mostly marine
organisms and many land plants. If I can name one particular
group that is suffering very badly at the moment, that is
mycology, the study of fungi. The CABI organisation has cut back
on jobs, Kew Gardens made a decision to axe it altogether in the
future, and the Edinburgh Botanical Gardens have already axed it.
If you look around the world, there are places like Canada which
actually do not have any systematic mycologists whatsoever. The
leading countries at this time, I would think, are probably the
USA and Sweden. I think the decline of this particular subject is
because the infrastructure within universities and institutions
has become deprecated by gradual losses through retirement and
things like that, rather than any particular planned
exercise.</p>

<p>77. Are you suggesting there has not been sufficient
succession planning?</p>

<p><i>(Professor Humphries)</i> No, there has not.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Lord Flowers</b></p>

<p>78. Whose fault is that?</p>

<p><i>(Professor Humphries).</i> I think there are several
reasons and several different people you could point at. I
suppose the main thing is that when people leave a particular
job, a department decides to shift into a different area of
research and there is no doubt that the expanse of molecular
biology, for example, has pushed out some of the more classical
approaches.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Chairman</b></p>

<p>79. You suggest in your written evidence that part of the
problem is finding young scientists suitable permanent positions.
Would you like to comment further about that?</p>

<p><i>(Professor Humphries).</i> Yes. I will give you one
example. The Systematics Association held a biennial conference
in September, which was designed particularly to encourage young
students to come and present their work. We had 95 papers
presented from all over the world. I should think, out of those,
there were two-thirds from students and there were some 20
posters as well. When I quizzed them about jobs they were going
back to, I do not think that there were any going back to a
permanent position. Some were going to post-doc positions, some
were still continuing with their PhDs, but there were quite a
number with no job whatsoever to go to.</p>

<p>80. So the interest is there, but the jobs are not?</p>

<p><i>(Professor Humphries)</i> The interest is there, I think,
on a global scale.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Lord Oxburgh</b></p>

<p>81. What about the role of systematics in under-graduate
biology teaching? This is a fundamental of what drives the
proportions of staff members in different disciplines within a
department. Has systematics significantly declined because there
is only a limited amount of time in an under-graduate curriculum?
Has systematics declined because of pressure on other disciplines
and, as a consequence, the number of staff members has
declined?</p>

<p><i>(Professor Humphries)</i> Yes. I can give you another
example. My own university was Kingston Upon Hull, and I did a
degree in botany there. The Botany Department had quite a large
systematic component. That department was swallowed up by zoology
and then zoology and botany together were swallowed up by
genetics, so the systematic component disappeared virtually
overnight - and so did several other subject areas - plant
pathology, for example.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior</b></p>

<p>82. I wonder. Professor Humphries, if the demise of certain
groups of organisms is based on the "need to know", in a way. If
one needs to know something about, say, insects populations for
disease control, shall we say, then there is a lot of effort put
into that, or if one needs to look soil micro-organisms effort is
put into that, to the distraction of other groups that are not
touched. It does seem to me that where there is a need to know,
then there is a lot of effort put into it. It is not even over
the whole spectrum.</p>

<p><i>(Professor Humphries)</i> I think even in groups with a
need to know basis, such as, for example, a study by the CABI
Organisation, the decline in the number of entomologists over the
past few years, as a direct result of their partners in the
commonwealth countries not buying into the system, has created
quite considerable gaps. Mosquito research, for example, is one
are where the number of systematists involved has gone down, and
there are plenty of other examples.</p>

<p>83. I have been told there is only one man in the United
Kingdom who knows anything about Culicoides.</p>

<p><i>(Professor Humphries)</i> That is right.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Chairman</b></p>

<p>84. Sir David, would you like to contribute on this question
about the decline over the last ten years and any particular
groups?</p>

<p><i>(Sir David Smith)</i> I would agree with Professor
Humphries on the question of fungi. I can actually give you a
personal experience. When I bought the flat in which I live in
Edinburgh two years ago I found a fruit vine growing out of the
skirting board. It took me two weeks to get an identification -
with all my knowledge - and that was a worry because of a
building and a survey. I can leave with you a talk by the Earl of
Cranbrook when he was Chairman of English Nature, in which he
says things like: "I am aware of the importance of fungi
ecosystems ... English Nature has no adequate in-house knowledge
of fungi... not able to devise programmes for conservation ...
aware of concerns regarding decline of fungi in woodland but have
no criteria for pesticide control and management." I have also
been involved with the marine environment, and let me give you
some examples. Within the last 15 years it has now known that
about 20 per cent of photosynthesis in the ocean is due to a
group called micro-algae, which simply were not known about until
the last couple of decades. As we now know, there is a great
importance of di-methyl-sulphide produced by plankton (this is
the work of Professor Lovelock in ocean climatology). Other
groups include nematodes and many insect groups - half of all
known species of spiders were described after 1966, and that is
still a growing problem, especially in tropical areas.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior</b></p>

<p>85. To what extent do the places of publication of systematic
information influence how systematic biology and systematics
biologists are perceived by the rest of the scientific community?
Coupled with this is the requirement, in describing a new species
in zoology, of conforming, I believe, to the fact that it has to
be published in writing and approved by an international
commission. I want to move on to the question of the web, but
could you answer that first part?</p>

<p><i>(Sir David Smith)</i> Perhaps I should preface what I say
by emphasising I am not a sytematist, I am by origin an
experimental biologist who has become interested in the
environment. The rest of the scientific community scarcely ever
see the publications in which systematic information is
published. The type of journal is very important, for example, in
molecular biology. You get respect for publishing in top
journals. It is far less important for systematics where it is
the reliability of the description which counts and is the
species, as they say, "a good species"? So, really, the rest of
the science community sees very little, and it has a rather
19<sup>th</sup> century image, as a consequence, of how
systematics operates.</p>

<p><i>(Professor Humphries)</i> Shall I enter as well? The effect
of this is quite considerable, really. I would like to think
there is a spectrum of activity in systematics and taxonomy, and
at one end of the spectrum is the alpha-taxonomy and at the other
end of it is the study of relationships and genomics and all the
interesting work of that kind. It is no surprise to say that the
lasting publications come from the descriptive work and from the
major monographs. These are the main bread and butter that
museums and some universities publish. The study of
relationships, on the other hand, especially using molecular data
and that sort of thing and where they fit into the tree of life,
are the sort of things you get into high-impact Journals such as
<i>Nature</i> and <i>Science</i>. Two exceptions of
alpha-taxonomy which do get into the top journals are, basically,
dinosaurs and human origins. They always get good press in <i>
Nature</i>, for example. A recent position paper by Charles
Godfray said that systematics should make use of the obvious
benefits of e-science. This is all very well, and to a great
extent he is making a play for the service end of systematics
nomenclature identification, and those sorts of things. However,
for many years to come there is going to be a definite need for
monographs, floras, formal lists, checklists - all those kind of
things - for the tropics, particularly, and for major monographs
which can be used in laboratories and in the field at the same
time. I would like to criticise the ISI system. The impacts of
papers are measured over a two-year period, on the whole, and
take no account of the lasting nature of the monograph. A
monograph, if it is written well, will last one hundred years or
more. So there is no assessment of how many times that is used.
Also, the way taxonomic information is cited is often left out of
any kind of equation. For example, let us suppose we had a new
account of a group with lots of new names and lots of new species
recognised. These names are used repeatedly in later
publications, but they are never considered to be citations. So I
think the impact factor needs to be re-assessed.</p>

<p>86. If I can just follow up this concept of Professor Godfray
and your rigorous defence of the monograph. I do not think anyone
is suggesting the monograph be no longer used as a medium for
publication. However, for example, amongst the many different
pieces of information we have had can I quote something from the
Natural Environment Research Council, who said that "If</p>

<p>taxonomy and systematics are to thrive in this country in the
future, as we hope they will, then</p>

<p>they must renew themselves; they must embrace modern methods
and techniques, such as genomics, bioinformatics, and the
worldwide web. This does not mean we still do not need to</p>

<p>address classic taxonomic questions - we certainly do - but we
need to use new techniques such</p>

<p>as ingenious, web-based solutions, recently suggested by
Godfray". Would you accept that? Do you accept that, at the
moment, one of the problems that systematics and taxonomy have is
one of perception amongst other scientists?</p>

<p><i>(Professor Humphries)</i> Yes, I would accept that, but I
would also defend the position that e-science is being rigorously
pursued. There is a new organisation, called GBIF which is
attempting to bring all the major databases of the globe
together. I work at the Natural History Museum and in the Natural
History Museum we have a whole section now devoted to writing the
front ends of databases to go on to the internet. So, turning to
genomics, the zoology department at the Natural History Museum
has made a switch over the last ten years or so from vertebrate
biology to invertebrate biology and, particularly, into process
research, and this takes advantage of all the large databases
containing sequence data as well as providing information to put
into that database. So I think it is being embraced, and I think
papers like Charles Godfray's are looking at one aspect. That was
the point I was trying to make.</p>

<p>87. If I might return to this, he is trying to introduce a
sense of urgency and excitement to a discipline which, at the
moment, has a poor image amongst, for example, students and the
like. In his paper I read that he thinks it would not be
unrealistic for the major private foundation, who wants to be
associated with, say, a first wave of revision of the
Lepidoptera. Is this not the sort of breadth of thinking that is
needed in order to introduce new funding and new interest,
alongside the sort of traditional monographs that you are
espousing?</p>

<p><i>(Professor Humphries)</i> I think all monographs should
venture to be on the web, as a matter of interest, but there are
still problems with priority of names and that kind of thing.
Again, in defence of what is actually going on, Norman MacLeod,
the head of our Palaeontology Department at the Natural History
Museum, runs a website which takes publications solely for
publication on the web, involving palaeontological material. In
terms of its look and what goes on, it looks very exciting to me.
So I think what is happening is that there has been a response,
but Charles Godfray, perhaps, is trying to push it faster than it
is actually going. That is my impression.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Lord Quirk</b></p>

<p>88. Could I just revert to what Sir David was saying a moment
ago about the somewhat 19<sup>th</sup> century image that
systematics and alpha-taxonomy tends to have? One is given the
impression overwhelmingly in the evidence that has been submitted
that our systematics is a kind of core to the whole of biology;
there is a kind of infrastructure to the whole of biology. Are we
to understand that not all biologists would agree with that, and
that they do not regard systematics as underlying everything that
they do?</p>

<p><i>(Sir David Smith)</i> I regret that I think I would agree
with you, my Lord. Too many modern, experimental biologists and
molecular geneticists do not, I am afraid, regard it as
fundamental to biology.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Chairman</b></p>

<p>89. Before we leave this particular area, could I just return
to Professor Godfray's proposals again, and ask you both: do you
think they are feasible? Over what time-scale, and what are the
resource implications for the United Kingdom's involvement in
such an essential, international initiative?</p>

<p><i>(Sir David Smith)</i> I think they are, in principle,
feasible. As I say, I am not a systematist, but from my
discussions with systematists some of them are deeply unhappy at
some of the details of how it would operate. If you look,
however, at other areas such as gene sequencing and things of
that kind, I think in principle it is feasible. If I may go back
to my problem with the fruit vine growing out of a skirting
board, for many areas now if I want to find out information I go
straight to the web. This was an area in which I could not do
that. I did not know where to begin - partly because if you go to
a natural history website you do not find anybody who can help
you there. I think there is such a natural tendency these days,
even for people of my age, to go to the web to find information -
we get very used to it. In serious science, in star surveys and
things of this kind, I think this is where it probably has to go,
particularly when you bear in mind that people are now putting
good illustrations on the web. I think, in the long run, this has
to be the way, but I am not a systematist.</p>

<p>90. The resource implication and the time-scale?</p>

<p><i>(Sir David Smith)</i> I am sorry, the time-scale is, as it
were, the length of the proverbial piece of string! What is
needed is the initial initiative and drive to start it going, to
help those who are able to do it to put it on the web. I come
from a learned society and I am aware, for example, in certain
areas there is much more knowledge with amateurs now than going
to professionals, and encouraging them. I think it needs a
multi-faceted approach. Perhaps we can come later as to how I can
see all this being organised.</p>

<p><i>(Professor Humphries)</i> I think systematists are fairly
maverick, to use that comparison with</p>

<p>astronomy, in the sense that they develop their own databases
and some are faster than others. The one that Charles Godfray
mentions in his article is by my colleague Paul Williams, who I
have</p>

<p>worked with for ten years. We run now three websites and it
has taken ten years to develop those three. One is just about to
come on-line and was paid for by the Nuffield Foundation. These
things take a lot of time and they take a lot of knowledge. Paul
Williams' own website dealing with bumble bees, of which there
are 240-odd species, has taken him most of his career to work up
into a reasonably satisfactory knowledge base, and his website is
terrific - as a result of him knowing the organisms well and
having a talent for writing those kinds of things. I think if you
are going to give it a push some agreement about priorities would
be a good thing, and then push into those areas, perhaps, the
things that we know are missing greatly under the CBD, for
example. That has certain requirements for certain parts of the
world, so it is best, probably, to concentrate there, but how
long it will take and how much it would cost is a big
question.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Lord Flowers</b></p>

<p>91. I want to ask questions to do with the universities.
Nowadays, university core funding is dominated by the Research
Assessment Exercise, at least for the research-intensive
universities. What effect has this had on the health of
systematic biology? Also, what has been the knock-on effect of
decisions taken by research councils about grant applications
from the universities? For that matter, what is the subject
background of the assessors?</p>

<p><i>(Sir David Smith)</i> If I may begin, I have at least five
reasons here. There are no systematists on the Research
Assessment Exercise panels for biology. This is not surprising,
given the paucity of systematists generally in universities. A
factor that is used in the research assessment, are so-called
"impact factors" in journals. Taxonomy journals have very low
impact factors. I think this is unfair, because when you describe
a new species this is indicated by the abbreviation that goes
after the name - you do not cite the original paper as you do,
say, with DNA structure. So, taxonomic journals have low impact
factors. Another factor in looking at success in research is the
size of grant income, and research grants to carry out taxonomy
are really quite small. Numbers of papers are important. In much
of modern science now work is increasingly in large groups, so
they produce many papers, but there is a regrettable tendency to
go in for what is called "salami slicing" - <i>i.e.</i>, instead
of publishing one big paper after two years they publish ten over
two years. That is not really possible in systematics research.
Books such as monographs are much less favoured than are papers,
and, in general, there is this horrible phrase "cutting edge".
Alpha taxonomy is not seen to use "cutting edge" techniques. If
you do the kind of taxonomy like looking at DNA and mitochondria,
it is not too difficult to get a grant, but the actual basic
business of needing to put a name on an organism (which is what
alpha-taxonomy is about) is not perceived as cutting edge. The
pressures on universities are considerable, and when there are
vacancies in posts such as taxonomy or ecology, there is a strong
tendency for universities to employ so-called molecular
ecologists or molecular taxonomists - people who use molecular
techniques.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Chairman</b></p>

<p>92. Are you saying that you are more likely to get a research
grant if you have already done a lot of papers, and because it
takes a long time to produce this sort of work you are likely to
have an apparently shorter track record?</p>

<p><i>(Sir David Smith)</i> Yes. The reality, hardly ever stated
in print, is that when people put in grant applications in the
rest of science, they have usually done part of what they are
applying for. I used to do it - although I do not apply for
grants any more.</p>

<p><i>(Professor Humphries</i>) I would rather comment on the
research council side. There was a meeting in Reading in July
2000 when the Chief Executive John Laughton gave a speech saying
that taxonomy should no longer be funded by the NERC because it
is not innovative - as Sir David has just said. NERC itself has
very little money available for competitive research, and moves
are now afoot within the organisation to harbour that principle.
It seems to me, by having a huge amount of money in thematic
research, rather than response mode, where you can apply from any
place for funding, has greatly decreased the amount of money that
is spent on taxonomy.  Of the research councils, it is only BBSRC
and NERC that you can really go for. Of those two, NERC is the
one, I would imagine, that should have it, but if you look at
their budget (and I have a paper by Jim Mallett, which you should
have received), compared with taxonomy some £137 million is
spent on science, and on taxonomy it is a very small amount, less
than £2 million, or something like that.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Lord Flowers</b></p>

<p>93. The amount of money is, of course, at the end of the day,
very significant, but the question is what starts the money off
at that level? NERC, as a matter of policy, has said that it will
only support work that is hypothesis-driven. That rules out
alpha-taxonomy from the word go.</p>

<p><i>(Professor Humphries)</i> It does.</p>

<p>94. Before you even consider how much money there is.</p>

<p><i>(Professor Humphries)</i> Yes, I accept that.</p>

<p>95. Does that not mean your organisation is no longer fit to
fund such work?</p>

<p><i>(Professor Humphries)</i> If you are not going to fund such
work then it is bound to die off, is it not? Looking at Ed
Wilson's comments, saying what the demands of the Convention on
Biological Diversity are going to be for this century, it is
going to be two things: trying to find out what there is out
there and then fitting it into the tree of life. The tree of life
research, which involves the molecular side and that sort of
thing, does give you your innovating end, but the basic building
blocks, which Professor May talked about ten years ago or more,
have got to be produced as well. It is the central aspect of
systematics. One of the most famous systematists of the 20th
century, Willi Hennig, said that the refined phylogenetic system
requires its building blocks and the tree all being studied at
the same time.</p>

<p>96. If I may make a remark, my Lord Chairman, it is a long
time now since I was in the research council, but in my day there
was the Science Research Council, of which I was Chairman, and it
was the Research Council of last resort. That is to say, if you
are interested in doing something in the field of one of the
oriented research councils and they would not pay, you could go
to the Science Research Council and make your case there. That
would catch up with the situation like alpha-taxonomy, but I do
not think we have such a body now.</p>

<p><i>(Professor Humphries)</i> No. In the case of the Flora
Europaea, for example, which is one of the most successfully
managed flora projects, which lasted from 1957 to 1980,
publishing in total six volumes with a revision of the first one,
the secretariat (which consisted of about three people) and all
the expenses for travel and so on was funded almost entirely from
an SERC grant throughout most of that period, or a series of
grants. The result was a highly useful flora.</p>

<p>97. The SERC was the research council of last resort at that
time</p>

<p><i>(Professor Humphries)</i> Yes.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Chairman</b></p>

<p>Sir David, I noted that in your written submission you point
out that despite their stated policy NERC actually do fund some
non-hypothesis-driven areas of research, such as gene sequencing.
How do you think they get away with it?</p>

<p><i>(Sir David Smith)</i> I think the problem probably lies in
this kind of area. Gene sequencing, which is not
hypothesis-driven, is modern, it is providing a core of
information which, hopefully, is going to be useful later in
molecular medicine, and so on. I think when research councils
such as NERC are confronted by taxonomy - again, with very few
taxonomists on the council - they just see tens of millions of
species and it takes years to write a monograph of 100 species,
and where do we go? I think it is this lack of any structural or
conceptual approach. It is not only gene sequencing, I think some
of the geological work that is funded is not
hypothesis-driven.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Lord Oxburgh</b></p>

<p>98. You said there was a lack of a structure. Within NERC or
within the community?</p>

<p><i>(Sir David Smith)</i> I think it is unfair to say NERC. I
think systematists working in their way are on one side and the
body with the money on the other, and there is a lack of an
intellectual framework to say how should we approach this. Of
course we cannot go funding monographs of every group of 100
species, but I think it needs a clearer approach.</p>

<p>99. In the evidence which we have seen, there has been a lack
of any quantitative grip or presentation of the problem. The
impression that has come across is of this enormous, infinite
infinity of work to be done. Frankly, faced with a proposal like
that the Treasury will not provide. I think what one would like
to see in many areas is some estimate of the size of the task, or
constraints on the task, the resources needed and the rate at
which progress will be made, because whether we like it or not
these are the terms on which research councils now operate. I
feel,</p>

<p>myself, that it is a lack of any of this element of approach
which has been quite damaging to the very important discipline
you represent. Would you agree with me?</p>

<p><i>(Sir David Smith)</i> I would agree. I note you have a
question on the sort of structure that ought to be there, and I
have views on that.</p>

<p>Chairman: Perhaps that leads nicely on to Lord Selborne's
question.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Earl of Selborne</b></p>

<p>100. It does. I think we are coming back, again, to the need
to find a package which the funders can buy into, and we
recognise that NERC do have a problem - as indeed do the other
research councils - with something which appears to be open-ended
and not dramatically different from what it was in the last
century. In the Linnean Society evidence, Sir David's society
points out that responsibility for funding is split between at
least four different government departments, each with different
priorities for systematics and its associated disciplines. It
goes on to refer to the United States' National Science
Foundation which "... has a Systematics and Evolutionary Biology
Committee which oversees a well-funded and dedicated programme
with initiatives such as their special competition, Partnerships
for Enhancing Expertise in Taxonomy ...". Is this a structure
that would recommend itself to Sir David for this country? If so,
how would you set up its terms of reference and how would they,
in turn, be able to get a grasp of something which is so
difficult for the other funding organisations to grasp at the
moment?</p>

<p><i>(Sir David Smith)</i> I think one can get some useful
guidelines from the so-called PEET initiative in the United
States. We do not have anything quite like the National Science
Foundation, but my own approach to this is influenced by my
experience as a member of the panel for the Darwin Initiative,
which I think was very successful. This was for introducing
taxonomic expertise into countries overseas. So my model would go
more on the Darwin Initiative than a research council model. This
is because when we viewed applications to the Darwin Initiative
we did not just judge them on research and merit, we had a range
of criteria, such as, in the Darwin Initiative "Will this leave a
footprint in the particular underdeveloped country?" We really
need more applications for poorly studied areas such as marine
microbiology. We were then able, without all the overwhelming
bureaucracy of a research council grants committee (which I have
sat on for quite long periods), to make very strategic grants.
Also, it was very bottom-up driven. In the case of something to
take forward here, I would myself focus on (if I was on a Darwin
Initiative panel for the UK) projects that further the
conservation of biodiversity in the United Kingdom. I think we
are already contributing to what is happening overseas, and I
think it should be wide enough not just to involve museums,
collections and universities but, also, learned societies
(because there are groups where all the expertise is virtually in
amateurs not in the professionals), environmental charities (I
have been a trustee of WWF) and, also, it ought to be able to
enter as the PEET initiative does - and as we did in the Darwin
Initiative - grant applications for educational projects, even as
low down as the primary sector. So, I think, rather than impose
some top-down strategy, one needs to look at what is the
bottom-up availability set within criteria such as "We will judge
your application and what it is going to do for the conservation
of biodiversity in the United Kingdom". In the Darwin Initiative
the Treasury gave us something like £3 million a year and,
as I say, I think it was very successful. It did depend on
having, in my time, an excellent Chair, who in my time was Sir
Crispin Tickell. Again, he was not a systematist but he could see
the broad strategic picture.</p>

<p><i>(Professor Humphries)</i> In my view, the real strength of
the UK research structure lies in the diversity of its funding
sources but only if you look at that across the whole spectrum of
sciences, and if one gets a grant turned down you can always turn
to one of the other ones or even a European source of funding. It
seems to me that consolidating things down into one single source
or one super body cuts out opportunities, especially if some
particular policy decision is made which says, for example, they
are not going to do anything with hypothesis-driven research.
Bringing things together is extremely difficult. Ever since I
have been a student, Kew Gardens and the National History Museum
directors have attempted to bring the two bodies into one
management structure, and it has never been worked out completely
how they might do that, so imagine if you try to bring together
research councils and, also, bring in the Scottish Office and the
Edinburgh Botanical Gardens - it would be extremely difficult to
do. I am involved with the PEET programme and this year they are
inviting a number of people over to the States to try and enhance
what they have done already and to pinpoint those areas of
priority. What I would like to see, I think, would be to have the
research councils re-think their remits and have some
systematists on the terrestrial and aquatic committees for, say,
NERC and start having some priority areas of funding so that
people like universities and museums anywhere can apply for
grants which are targeted into targeted research and take it
through on that basis.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Lord Flowers</b></p>

<p>101. I was a bit bemused, my Lord Chairman, by Professor
Humphries' statement that he believes that a multiplicity of
funding sources is much better than the alternative of one major
system. It is in this country with this multiplicity of research
councils that the funding of alpha-taxonomy in universities, at
any rate, has fallen to the floor. It is our very system that has
done that, because they are able to pass the buck to somebody
else.</p>

<p><i>(Professor Humphries)</i> To clarify, yes, they have passed
the buck instead of actually implementing within their own
programmes the taxonomic part. It depends who runs these
organisations and who they get on to their committees that
decides the subject areas, it seems to me. I would like to see
that built up so that it would include systematics rather than
trying to produce some super body.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Chairman</b></p>

<p>102. So you would rather change the organisation than the
whole system?</p>

<p><i>(Professor Humphries)</i> I think it would be easier to do
that.</p>

<p><i>(Sir David Smith)</i> If I may, my Lord Chairman, I would
like to add two further points. If the eventual solution is to go
back to the research councils, I do hope it will begin with an
analysis of why the NERC taxonomy initiative did not really have
the success it was hoped. I have seen a confidential assessment
of that initiative (confidential to NERC) and that is why I
worry. On the second point - Lord Flowers' point -I have sat on
the research grant committees of three different research
councils and the really difficult areas are those which fall
between two research councils, and there are committees which
have tried to link two research councils, but in our present
structure it does not work.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Lord Quirk</b></p>

<p>103. This is a question addressed specifically to Sir David
Smith, concerning your letter to Mr Meacher and Professor King.
You say, with reference to the proposals formulated by the Select
Committee under the Chairmanship of Lord Dainton ten years ago,
that"... a decade later the plight of systematic biology research
has worsened, the situation now extending into biology of most
kinds of whole organism ... still too few people employed ..."
etc, etc. When the Committee reported ten years ago the
Government response was to say "It is for the academic and
research community in biology to assess the adequacy of the
supply of qualified systematists. It must be for that community
to consider the relative place, the different approaches to the
study of biology ... etc, etc "... and to determine and make
known their own recruitment policies." What is there in your
letter to Mr Meacher and Professor King that might provoke a more
helpful response, in your view, than that? Would they not still
be in a position to say that it is for the profession of biology
to set its own priorities?</p>

<p><i>(Sir David Smith)</i> I do not think it is very easy to
answer because (and this is where Professor Humphries may
disagree with me) coming from the non-systematics area of science
I am aware of how rapidly we network - big research groups get
together - and we can get together an initiative. The classic in
this case was the development of the human genome, which had a
lot of critics when it was first mooted, but they got themselves
together and it was well-organised. It is somehow in the nature
of systematics that they are not such a well-integrated community
with very little contact between, say, somebody who looks at the
systematics of protozoa and somebody who looks at birds. They do
not cohere in the same way. Systematics is much more an area
pursued by individuals rather than large research groups, with
their layers and their leaders and their post-docs. I do not
think it is fair to say "Leave it to the science and the
systematics community". Also, the systematics community should be
divided between the universities, the museums, the gardens, zoos
and the collections, and there is not any good coherence between
them. Although some of what I say may, by implication, criticise
the research councils, I do not mean that because they have a
limited remit too, which is why my experience of the Darwin
Initiative - which I think was successful - leads me to think in
that direction rather than saying "use an existing structure like
a government department or a research council".</p>

<p>104. You talk about the Institute of Biology, which has a
working group on this. What has the Institute of Biology done
over the past decade to address this general problem?</p>

<p><i>(Sir David Smith)</i> The reference to the Institute of
Biology is this: that it perceives that other sciences, like
chemistry and physics, are far more effective political lobbyists
because they are seen to speak with one voice. They see that the
problem in biology in the broad sense, and I even include parts
of medicine, is that it does not speak with one voice. So the
working group (of which I was once a member) aims to set up a
bio-science federation to try and pursue particular projects, and
the only particular project that they had as an example was one
we were running in systematics, and they took that as one of
their examples. There has now been an agreement to go ahead and
develop a bio-science federation but this is now at what is
called the implementation group stage. The Institute of Biology
is trying to get together a lobbying structure that seems to have
worked so well for chemistry and physics, and systematics is only
one small problem.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Chairman</b></p>

<p>105. Sir David, how do you think the systematics community
could allay Professor King's fears expressed in his reply to your
letter that a national body would just become a talking shop?</p>

<p><i>(Sir David Smith)</i> It depends on that national authority
body's status, its funding and what it can do. One of your
questions refers to the United Kingdom Systematics Forum which
did produce a very good document The <i>Web of Life</i>, which I
am sure you have seen. However, these were hard-pressed people
working in their spare time, many of them in museums where the
emphasis is much more on revenue-generating projects rather than
on research. They just do not have the time and the energy to do
the very specialist lobbying. It depends on the terms and
conditions of this national body. If it has authority over some
money, for example, then they will have authority.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Lord Haskel</b></p>

<p>106. On this question of national bodies, perhaps you can
clarify what has happened to the UK Systematics Forum. Also,
various submissions of written evidence have suggested there is
now a need for a new national body for systematic biology. Does
this mean that the Systematics Forum has failed to carry out its
task or does it need resuscitating?</p>

<p><i>(Sir David Smith)</i> I am sure you are familiar with this,
but it was originally funded with a temporary grant from the
Office of Science and Technology. That grant came to an end in
1998, just about the time of the publication of The Web of Life.
This was then taken under the wing of the Linnean Society and we
in the Linnean then commissioned a review by Valerie Bott, who is
a member of the Museums and Galleries Commission, of just what
had been the problem. There were a variety of problems, apart
from those I have already mentioned, such as people working in
their spare time, the chairman left for a post in Scotland, the
co-ordinator left to do some research, and while this strategy
sets out priorities - it set out for example a priority should be
the targeting of studies and organisms relevant to society -
there was then nothing further and deeper, for example, "We need
to do this", nor did they have the time or the effort to do it.
They were going to make a submission to an appropriate research
council but, as Professor Humphries has already said, there was
then a conference organised by NERC at which was raised this
business that problem-orientated research would not be funded. I
would not wish to see a body like the Systematics Forum, as it
was, resuscitated, because I do not think you can expect it to do
any more unless it has a status and authority, somebody to report
to, a line management, whatever you call it.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Chairman</b></p>

<p>107. You are nodding in agreement?</p>

<p><i>(Professor Humphries)</i> Yes, I agree entirely. Like a lot
of initiatives this one did not have any muscle, it was
irrelevant, and it lacked political clout. Steve Blackmore, who
was in the chair, did work very hard at it and in addition to <i>
The Web of Life</i> he did produce some kind of working structure
about where to move next. Still on the museum computer is a data
base of specialists throughout the country in particular areas,
and it was moving towards the idea, "How do we bring these people
together", but that has not been up-dated for nearly two years
now. Officially, since the removal of OST funding, effectively
the project is dead, as Sir David has already described.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Earl of Selborne</b></p>

<p>108. Clearly Professor King was mildly disillusioned, by his
reference to a talking shop, with the ability of the systematics
community to carry this forward in the past. Do you think if the
resources had been there - and I recognise they were not, it had
become a voluntary measure for hard-pressed workers without
resources - had there been a funding stream, would the
systematics community from somewhere have come forward with a
strategy which would have been coherent and capable of further
advancement through suitably funded programmes? At the moment we
seem to have had a UK Systematics Forum which run into the sands,
run out of ideas, run out of momentum, and I understand there was
a lack of resources, but if the resources had been there to at
least prime the pump, what would have happened?</p>

<p><i>(Sir David Smith)</i> I do think it would have had more of
a success but, as I say, I am not sure I would have started from
there, as it were. I would have constructed it differently, had
different people on it, I think it has to have users of
systematics as well as systematists, a wider variety of bodies.
For example, I am aware that both DEFRA and NERC have
conservation of biodiversity amongst their priorities, but people
able to articulate taxonomy into those priorities should be on
such a committee. In other words, I would really have constructed
it differently with a different remit. Again, I come back to the
one pragmatic example which worked very well, which was the
Darwin Initiative.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Lord Oxburgh</b></p>

<p>109. Perhaps I could turn to the question of what perhaps we
wrongly describe as the systematics community, because what has
come across is that we have a rather fragmented, disparate group,
and interactions between that group or those groups with
Government and other official bodies. Are those interactions
satisfactory? Do they exist? Is this a bit of a fluid
relationship?</p>

<p><i>(Sir David Smith)</i> I will answer very briefly before
passing rapidly to Professor Humphries. I have just no experience
of these kind of interactions.</p>

<p><i>(Professor Humphries)</i> NHM and places like us were
formerly members of the Civil Service Department and that became
detached and as a result we all set our own agendas for what
should be done. The interactions tend to be of a very personal
nature between one individual in one institution and another
individual in another institution. They become a little more
formal when there are things like contract work. For example, the
links we have with University College are quite formal in the
sense we go for European funding and that sort of thing. In a
similar way, the student grants which we get force us to make
links with universities so students can get degrees and register
properly and so on, and they are conducted in the manner in which
they are normally conducted in universities. So the links are
pretty fluid, to answer your question.</p>

<p>110. Can I pursue this, it is a little off to one side but I
think it is important. You mention European Union funding, and
that is something which has not come into our discussion today.
Is that significant in the systematics area?</p>

<p><i>(Professor Humphries)</i> In one or two cases. The success
stories that I know about are, for</p>

<p>example, SYST-RESOURCE programme or the COBICE system, and
there are two new ones</p>

<p>now, one in Stockholm and one in Madrid, and this uses Marie
Curie grants and various other</p>

<p>schemes to bring people together. I have just come back from
Copenhagen, paid for by the COBICE project. It proves to be
extremely useful when you are doing joint work. That is one
level. The other level is the network, and Jeremy Young in the
Natural History Museum produced a network for looking at
palaeontological problems which brought in industry and all sorts
of organisations that were useful in oil exploration.</p>

<p><i>(Sir David Smith)</i> Professor Humphries referred earlier
to a successful project called Flora Europea which has been going
since 1957. Recently, the Linnean Society together with a range
of European bodies has acquired a substantial grant of several
million euros for a project called Fauna Europea, which is aiming
to make lists of animal species in Europe along a similar pattern
of Flora Europea, and that involves a networking between
different countries. That is a little more towards making species
lists. It will have less impact on taxonomy but there is European
money and there has been a significant input.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior</b></p>

<p>111. Just one thing about funding. I was reading in the papers
this morning about what by any accounts is the absolutely massive
funding in the States to deal with bio-terrorism - billions of
dollars going into it - working on the need to know about the
organisms around us and monitoring and surveillance. Could this
lead to an increase in the study of organisms, a bit like the old
Sputnik which stimulated so much research in the States 30 or 40
years ago?</p>

<p><i>(Sir David Smith)</i> I am not sufficient of a
microbiologist to know. Undoubtedly in areas like anthrax and
smallpox that would be something of intense molecular taxonomy. I
am not sure that would extend into the really, to my taste,
needed areas like marine microbiology or even, for that matter,
at an earlier time someone mentioned soil microbiology. That is
not terribly well understood either. I cannot see it doing that.
That would be very closely allied to pathogenic organisms.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Lord McColl of Dulwich.</b></p>

<p>112. Do you think it is possible to indicate how much taxonomy
is enough to maintain or improve biodiversity and how much should
the UK contribute to that global task?</p>

<p><i>(Sir David Smith)</i> Again, I can only go back to my
experience on the Darwin Initiative where the Treasury allocated
us £3 million a year for projects to help the position in
under-developed countries overseas. We felt that was just about
enough in terms of the amount of expertise we actually have in
this country and what we give elsewhere. If it had been £30
million, I think it would have been a waste of money because we
do not have that number of taxonomists. I am guessing here but
the average cost of a project in the Darwin Initiative is about
£30 to £45,000 so you can get quite a lot of those
for a similar sum, and then you spread into education and take an
analytical look at what you mean by conserving biodiversity -
woodlands, seashores, pasture land, agricultural land - and then,
when you get to woodlands, what is the big problem in Britain
about conserving biodiversity in British woodlands, and you can
see from there what is actually out there and can contribute to
this. I can say from my knowledge, we must know all about the
fungi associated with tree roots, but if you gave me the money to
do that I could not find anybody to do it.</p>

<p>113. Professor Humphries, would you like to add anything to
that?</p>

<p><i>(Professor Humphries)</i> Yes, I would like to talk about
national institutions and the ones which were built throughout
Europe. They, largely from the late 18<sup>th</sup> century
onwards, brought together materials from the spoils of
colonialism, if you like, and there was a gradual assembly of all
this material, and then during the 20<sup>th</sup> century there
was a processing of all of this, and that is when the business of
writing big floras came into being and monography work and so on.
The development of Agenda 21, CBD, in 1992 has led to the Darwin
Initiative, as you have heard already, which is an extremely good
programme, and to build on that in the future has led us to think
that we need to do bilateral agreements with countries that we
have good resources from, like Central America, Nepal, India and
so on, and repatriate the data and work jointly with people in
those countries to give them the expertise too. It is a sad fact
that the Western institutions still hold the key to this
so-called taxonomic impediment, and if we set up a series of
priorities within the remit of CBD then you can move that
forward.</p>

<p>114. So it is the capacity-building we have been hearing about
from all quarters?</p>

<p>(Professor Humphries) To some extent, yes.</p>

<p>Chairman: Thank you very much indeed. It only remains for me
to thank you both, Sir David and Professor Humphries, very much
for coming this morning and for the written evidence you have
already given to us. Thank you very much indeed.</p>

<p><b>LORD MAY OF OXFORD, a Member of the House, President, Royal
Society and</b></p>

<p><b>DR RACHEL QUINN, Policy Unit, Royal Society,
examined.</b></p>

<p align="center"><b>Chairman</b></p>

<p>115. Good morning, Lord May, welcome to our Sub-Committee. You
are wearing two hats this morning, I understand. One as President
of the Royal Society and the other as yourself, a very eminent
scientist. It might be helpful on occasion in your evidence to
clarify on which behalf you are speaking in answering some of the
questions. Perhaps you would be kind enough to introduce your
colleague, who is very welcome?</p>

<p><i>(Lord May of Oxford)</i> Thank you. This is Rachel Quinn,
who has a PhD in Ecology from Imperial College, who in the Royal
Society is the person in the Policy Unit who sits on top of these
kinds of issues. I thought it be would helpful for me to have her
here and helpful for her to have the experience of the
meeting.</p>

<p>116. Indeed. Presumably Rachel has been involved in the
written evidence we have received from the Royal Society?</p>

<p><i>(Dr Quinn)</i> Yes, I was.</p>

<p>117. Perhaps I can start the questioning. Could you tell us
whether, and to what extent, you have used taxonomy or taxonomic
information in your own scientific career? Can you also say
something about the broader significance of systematics to
society. I know you have an interest in that.</p>

<p><i>(Lord May of Oxford)</i> Let me first, far from clarifying
which hat I am wearing, further confuse you. I see myself as
appearing before you in a sort of mixture, myself with a
professional interest in these questions and, with all due
immodesty, I tend to be the person who, when one has
international conferences on biodiversity - like the one the US
National Academy of Science had a few years ago, the Biodiversity
Two meeting, a decade after the one which gave us that word,
which tends to involve people in taxonomy, systematics,
conservation - gets asked these days to give the talk on how many
species there are and rates of extinction. I also will
occasionally refer to the document the Royal Society gave you, in
which I was not involved but with which I agree point by point. I
should also declare an interest as Lord Oxburgh's predecessor as
chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Natural History Museum
and various other interests.</p>

<p>118. Thank you.</p>

<p><i>(Lord May of Oxford)</i> In turning to your question, I
would like to take a couple of minutes by way of preamble to say,
in particular, if you can summarise the Royal Society's document
in three sentences, it says that systematics, beta-taxonomy,
really has benefited from the Dainton Report and is fairly
healthy; a mixture of the Dainton Report and the scientific
advances which make that an exciting subject. Alpha-taxonomy,
which I would call descriptive taxonomy, is not in such good
shape. Thirdly, the access to this information seriously needs
being brought into the 20th and maybe even the 21<sup>st</sup>
century. Still coming to the question you ask, views in science
of taxonomy and systematics to my mind span the spectrum from, at
one extreme, those who see it as stamp collecting - and indeed in
my view many of the practitioners although doing valuable work
are essentially stamp collectors - and at the other end those who
could be summed up rather rhetorically perhaps by saying,
"Without the bricks that taxonomy gives us and the building plan
that systematics gives for putting them in place, the house of
biology is a meaningless jumble." There are of course lots of
problems in biology which do not need such taxonomy and
systematics, but there are many problems in ecology, evolution
and in environmental science that do. Many fundamental and
evolutionary questions depend on knowing what we have today and
indeed what we had in the past, and that partly is why with the
new molecular techniques of systematics - putting things,
reclassifying, looking at the tree of life - beta-taxonomy in
this appalling jargon, which is one of the faults of the subject,
is healthy. Ecology - and I will give you three examples in a
minute - often suffers from the lack of a taxonomic data base,
and our ability to predict what will happen if extinction rates
accelerate and whether ecological systems will be able to
continue to deliver services. Those are fundamental questions but
their application to practical issues from ecology are hindered
greatly by the lack of taxonomic knowledge and systematic
compilation of such knowledge as we have. Now the three examples.
The problem which engaged me first 30 years ago, which drew me
from physics into ecology, was the issue of how the structure of
an ecological system, the number of species in it, the web of
connections amongst them, relates to the ability of particular
systems to handle a disturbance or an alien or an extinction of a
species, and that is hugely handicapped by the fact that
disproportionately alpha-taxonomy, focuses on the things that
taxonomists like, which are vertebrates. So our ability to answer
questions about food web structure are hugely hindered by the
fact that the information tends to come in terms of the links
that connect the various named bird species but then there are
other huge groups which are just dumped in as spiders or bugs
which undercut an analytic understanding. The second example.
Setting aside whether it is important for our continued aesthetic
or dependence on services to preserve species, if you agree you
want to conserve species, a great deal of the current activity in
that area, in which I am involved, consists of identifying hot
spots. Chris Humphries, whom you have just spoken to, identified
with one of these approaches of particular interest and
particular efficiency in conserving things. But if you turn to
look at what is actually being implemented by conservation
movements, it is virtually entirely based on data involving
birds, mammals and some plants. There is a blithe assumption that
because they often have bigger ranges, that will conserve
invertebrates and other organisms. When you look at that in
detail, particular studies in Britain and the United States, it
turns out not to be true. If you ask the question, are we wanting
to preserve the greatest amount of independent evolutionary
history which is written in the genetic constitution of species,
our vast taxonomic ignorance of invertebrates leaves us unable to
answer the question of what we ought to be doing to act
optimally. The third example is not my own but an ex-colleague's
from Princeton. He is a little unfashionable as an ecologist in
that he is interested in some down-to-earth questions which
combine fundamental issues, such as, given, inevitably, that the
tropics are going to be subjected to more and more use by humans,
what are the minimal number of tree species you need to preserve
in order to preserve, say, the five primates in a conservation
area. That is unfashionable because many of his colleagues say
that is a counsel of despair already, we want to preserve
pristine cathedrals as sacred sites, but the practicalities are
that you want to know what we have to do, recognising we will
lose something to preserve as much as possible. He again is
hugely handicapped by taxonomic ignorance of the plant and tree
species and many of the invertebrate populations in the area he
works on.</p>

<p>119. We heard from our two previous witnesses that mycology is
a great area of difficulty. Would you agree with that?</p>

<p><i>(Lord May of Oxford)</i> It is one among many. If you heard
from one of the mycological chauvinists, you would have heard a
grotesquely exaggerated account of that.</p>

<p>Chairman: I am sure we did not!</p>

<p align="center"><b>Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior</b></p>

<p>120. I was going to quote to you your own words but you have
done it already</p>

<p><i>(Lord May of Oxford)</i> Without attribution!</p>

<p>121. "The house of biological research is a meaningless
jumble." When I started off as a scientist I suppose I was a
systematist at one time. It led on to many other things. You have
already identified a number of areas, I would particularly
identify insects as being very much in need of study. The
question is, how to change this. To the previous witnesses I
suggested maybe it was a question of the need to know about
certain things. If you can identify areas where you do need to
know, and you have given the example of tropical areas and
support of vertebrates there, then you can focus in on that.
Would that be a way to repair the problems that there are and the
big gaps you have identified?</p>

<p><i>(Lord May of Oxford)</i> I would say, yes and no. Yes, an
area that I can see being sexy and commanding funding is the
sorts of problems I outlined, but the kind of information you
want has to have been laid down earlier by people whose main
concern was just the obsessive focus on finding out what is there
in the invertebrate fauna. That is to say, I personally do not
think that the answer is finding particular projects which have
clear application and using that as the excuse to develop
alpha-taxonomy. I think there has to be a commitment to the
subject for its own sake because you cannot really know what it
is you are going to need to know until you have a better feel for
it. Let me put it another way: taxonomy, systematics is a
community at present that is very weak on self-analysis. Many of
the things you will have heard, for example, about the state of
alpha-taxonomy I believe are impressions validated by repeated
assertion. One of the things in our document is the suggestion
that we need a clearer understanding of exactly what it is we do
not know and what are the shortfalls. One which we have a rough
idea of, but it would be better if we had a better understanding,
is the demography of the discipline. About a third of all the
people who work in taxonomy systematics work on vertebrates,
about a third on plants and about a third on invertebrates,
whereas by the most conservative estimates there are a hundred
times the number of invertebrates than there are vertebrate
species, so one of the things we need to do is shift that and yet
it is not clear to me how you do that. Another which underlies
the input you had from DEFRA, who just felt the whole thing was
too much, is that we have currently got named and recorded
something like 1.5 million species, give or take 10 per cent -
amazingly, we do not know the number - and credible estimates of
how many there might be of other species and plants and animals
and fungi alive on earth with us today plausibly range from 5 to
15 million, I would guess 7 million, and if that is right, that
means there is another 5 million to be classified. Currently we
are adding to knowledge net at the rate of about 10,000 species a
year, about 13,000 when we resolve synonyms, so at that rate it
will take us 500 years to do it, and I have some comments on that
later. One of the things I think we need is more of a commitment
to basic taxonomy, to finding out what is there for its own sake
but done in different ways, and using the information which comes
out in a much more high-tech way than the discipline itself is
always comfortable with. That is going to need, to my mind, a
blend of the people who are in the discipline today and new kinds
of people, the sort of thing Charles Godfray has suggested to
you.</p>

<p>122. Like so many things, it seems to me that the start-off in
what you are saying must occur at school.</p>

<p><i>(Lord May of Oxford)</i> Yes.</p>

<p>123. I am amazed how little interest children at school have
in science in general, let alone biological science, let alone
systematic biology, and I am not sure how one handles that.</p>

<p><i>(Lord May of Oxford)</i> Again, I am not sure it is as true
as the really bleak picture would paint. If I remember from the
Joint Nature Conservancy Council, some eight years or so ago we
were presented with a rough study which to my memory, which may
be faulty, suggested that among young children and teenagers
amateur entomological clubs and societies were as healthy as they
have ever been. That is something that one ought to know, because
if it is true it is important, and if it is not, among many
things one needs to re-invigorate the subject at that level. But
equally the suggestion is that the people thus drawn into
biology, as they proceed up through secondary school and
university, get deflected out to seemingly more exciting areas,
partly because the excitement they had experience when young is
now displaced to the intellectual excitement of molecular biology
whereas taxonomy as presented seems relatively dreary. My feeling
is that need not be so. If you have a combination of existing
crafts of taxonomy with much more a presentation of its ultimate
fruit as in the idiom of information technology, you may lose
fewer of those people. All these discussions are handicapped by
the appalling lack of analytic information about it.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Earl of Selborne</b></p>

<p>124. I would like to follow up Lord May's very interesting
observation that down there at the grass roots there are people
who are quite passionately keen on biodiversity, as it is now
called, certainly in learning on the ground. In the last ten
years at least, as the Royal Society points out, beta-taxonomy
has been re-invigorated, molecular biology and other things have
played a large part in that, so the trick now is how do we get
alpha-taxonomy re-invigorated. Lord May has referred to laying
down information, not the sort of concept which lends itself
apparently to a lot of support from the research councils but,
nevertheless, if something innovative which captured the
imagination not just of the research councils but perhaps society
as a whole could come forward, it may do the trick of
re-invigorating alpha-taxonomy, very much needed with the
biodiversity projects and our commitments to the Convention for
Biological Diversity. That leads me to the Royal Society's
support of Professor Charles Godfray's proposal, simply because I
think you see this as something which apparently might capture
imagination, might get some additional funding, not just from the
normal sources. I wonder if Lord May would like to comment on
whether an international initiative such as that, or indeed some
other international initiative, might be the trick for sparking
this re-invigoration of alpha-taxonomy.</p>

<p><i>(Lord May of Oxford)</i> Again, yes and no. Going back to
one step, if one goes to Selborne itself and the field station
there and you see the enthusiastic young kids, you wonder what we
do wrong with them afterwards. Charles Godfray himself was one
such young child who kept the interest but fused it into
something that is right at the cutting edge of ecological
evolutionary research based often on taxonomic things. We need
more people like that. Whether we are going to do it by getting
an international group, I do not know, but the problem with
international groups, particularly the ones put together with
taxonomists and systematists, is that insofar as it is
permissible to make generalities about the personality type which
ends up in a discipline, they tend not to be very good at having
the Godfray-like vision. There are, as you probably know, at
least a dozen different initiatives to produce the global data
base that works to a common format, and they have been working at
this for ten years and we do not have it yet. The Global
Biodiversity Informatics Facility may eventually do it and there
are within that movement some particular people but,
constitutionally, I think ultimately things come down to people
rather than mechanisms. It is a mixture of the two. I would be
wary of just prescribing a particular mechanism because I would
join my voice to the chorus who have felt that the systematics
forum, while not without usefulness, certainly was not the
solution to some of these problems we had hoped it might</p>

<p align="center"><b>Chairman</b></p>

<p>125. What would it take to realise the Godfray vision?</p>

<p><i>(Lord May of Oxford)</i> Ultimately what we are trying to
do is engage. We keep being told there are fewer people at the
start of their career, but we cannot be sure because we do not
have statistics on that and we do not have good analytical
statistics on the number of under-graduate and graduate courses
as best I understand it, but if we had that factual knowledge and
it was distressing, it is going to take a long time to fix it. We
have to engage young people and we have to put in place in
courses and we have to have incentives to do that. Part of it is
going to be embracing a vision of taxonomy that includes the
present craft of obsessive description but in partnership or
otherwise so it is much more directly joined to either
fundamental research applications in evolution or, more commonly,
a mixture of basic research and application in ecology and
conservation biology, and it has to do it moreover in ways that
break free of the fashion that accords effort roughly equally to
vertebrates, invertebrates and plants, and accords the effort
proportionately to where the independent, evolutionary history
resides. Even answering that question automatically engages you
with molecular biologists.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Lord Flowers</b></p>

<p>126. My Lord Chairman, we have been told that the Research
Assessment Exercise has led to a decrease in the systematic
biology done within universities. If you agree with that, Lord
May, do you have any consequential comments on the nature of the
process? Anyway, to what extent can any such decrease be
mitigated by the work of non-university institutions, such as the
NHM and the Royal Botanic Gardens?</p>

<p><i>(Lord May of Oxford)</i> I do not know whether the RAE has
had an effect. The RAE has had various effects but I cannot
imagine any human institution which could have had as many
effects as are attributed to it. Again, it would be more
convincing if it were backed with some factual analysis. It is
true that some of the RAE assessment committees, but only a few,
were sufficiently ill-informed about using citation analysis or
impact factors for journals as not to realise they cannot be used
except discipline by discipline because they vary so much. The
average lifetime - just as a digression, parenthetically - of a
citation, in the sense from when the paper is published to when
the modal citation was, varies from something of the general
order of a year to two years in molecular biology to more than
seven years in ecology. As the impact factor for journals is
calculated only over the last three years of citations of the
paper, you can see some of the problems which creep in, but most
of the panels are aware of that. Turning to the larger question
of whether the decreasing investment in courses and otherwise in
universities can be picked up by dedicated institutions - Kew,
NHM and others - taxonomy and systematics always has been
primarily practised in museums. It in fact gives a particular
problem for such institutions. The Natural History Museum, for
example, is supported by the Department of Culture, Media and
Sport, most of whose museums have a modest degree of scholarship
in support of the collections but which are totally dissimilar to
the Natural History Museum which is more than half a fundamental
research institute, like the Max Plank Institute, the world's
leading one in taxonomy and systematics. That is inevitable but
it is not going to flourish unless it is connected to thriving
programmes at least to the under-graduate level in universities.
It is not going to thrive for two reasons. The obvious one is
that it will not get the flow-through of the next generation of
younger people. The less obvious one is, what more responsibly
conducted bibliometric analyses show, that the value for money
you get from research, the output in papers and citations and
patents and the inspirations for patents in relation to the money
you spent earlier, is a factor two or more better in those
countries where research is ordinarily done in universities or
university-like places, whereas dedicated research institutes
although they may do wonderful science tend to do it in a less
cost effective way, and I think that is because they tend to
evolve rigidities by virtue of their separation from the
continual presence of the irreverent young which is a
characteristic of the best research places. So the trick in
places like the Natural History Museum, which will always be the
primary site for alpha-taxonomy, is to make sure that it is
richly connected through joint appointments and other programmes
to universities, both for the next generation and for the
liveliness that that brings. The Natural History Museum in my
opinion, and I do not doubt in Lord Oxburgh's opinion, has done
an excellent job on this, others have not. I do not think the
answer is then picking up the slack but they will always be the
key parts of the programme. I think the answer is research
councils being less driven by facile waves of fashion and making
longer-term investment in subjects like taxonomy, which is stamp
collecting but is much more an enabling discipline, and a
recommendation that special provision be made in that sense. Just
as the Dainton Report suggested the emergence of molecular
systematics was going to transform beta-taxonomy, to help bring
that about by short-term special funding from NERC, so too we
ought to be thinking of how one transforms in certain ways along
the lines of Charles Godfray, and I have a couple of other ideas
which, regardless of the questions, I will manage to shoe-horn
in, which will be the subject of special fostering of
alpha-taxonomy by appropriate research councils and others.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Chairman</b></p>

<p>127. Lord May, we have heard that the three major institutions
are responsible for 90 per cent of the UK's systematic output. Is
that a fair assessment? Has it gone up or down?</p>

<p><i>(Lord May of Oxford)</i> It sounds reasonable but (a) I do
not know and (b) I am not sure anybody knows. The interesting
question is whether anybody has looked at it as distinct from
pulled a figure out of the air and said it a lot.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Lord Flowers</b></p>

<p>128. Lord May made much of the need for these institutions
being closely networked in with universities and so on. Hear,
hear to that, and I believe it is taking place to a reasonable
extent at least in the post-graduate field in research. But
unless there are under-graduates coming forward you do not start
the process off.</p>

<p><i>(Lord May of Oxford)</i> That is right.</p>

<p>129. I do not know that these institutions have done very much
at the under-graduate level.</p>

<p><i>(Lord May of Oxford)</i> It is not just our problem. To go
back a hundred years, most of the major universities had a museum
which was actively engaged in the teaching process. If you go to
North America, my old university, Princeton, has just closed down
the museum, and most of the ones which survive are there as a
kind of gentle ornament.</p>

<p>130. Manchester, I am glad to say, is very active in this.</p>

<p><i>(Lord May of Oxford)</i> In North America, which I know
better, I would say Berkeley, under the inspired leadership of
its director, David Lindberg and his wife, to my mind is the only
example of a university museum which is still right at the front
of both taxonomy and research. Michigan tries, but most of the
others are fading because it is difficult. My view is you do not
have to have the museum in the university, it is more having a
leader who has this more generous vision of how the necessary, in
a sense, stamp-collecting personality gets connected to the
fruits of that labour, and it is seen as a necessary enabling
activity rather than a discipline in itself.</p>

<p>Chairman: Lord Rea, you were going to ask about teaching but
do you think it has been covered?</p>

<p align="center"><b>Lord Rea</b></p>

<p>131. My question was about teaching in schools and
universities and you have been talking about that for last 15
minutes, so I do not think there is an awful lot more to be said.
I was going to ask you to develop that theme which you have just
touched on, which is how to capture the obsessive descriptive
stamp-collecting personality and connect it to the apparently
more exciting aspects of science, and perhaps to not regard stamp
collecting as a dead subject, equivalent to people in anoraks
train spotting, but maybe to realise actually some people get
quite a lot of excitement out of stamp collecting and it is not
such a dead end.</p>

<p><i>(Lord May of Oxford)</i> Again, I have no easy answers. It
seems to me the places which do continue to teach courses and
continue to engage good students in the UK are the places where
there are individuals who combine that interest with a wider
canvas. There are a bunch of younger people in this country who
are as good as you will find anywhere. They do need a degree of
encouragement, I think, because by the time you get right at the
top it is often seen as rather an old fashioned thing to do.
There is the further problem that there are so many areas of
science which are interesting today compared to the past. So in
one sense the physical sciences suffer because many of the people
who might have done it yesterday now go into a vastly expanded
biological science, and within that taxonomy suffers because
people who went into it because they had an interest in natural
history discover other areas. You could argue, it is trying to
keep pace with the frontiers which exist and the people we put
in, but that widens it well beyond 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Lord Rea: When I was at school I had a very good botany
teacher and he got me interested in describing all the species in
a grid, but, as you say, I got seduced away from that by the
zoology teacher who was more exciting, and then at university I
got seduced away into medicine from zoology, so it is difficult
going on being a stamp collector when there are so many other
attractions.</p>

<p>Chairman: A lot of competition. Can we move on to Lord
Selborne. If we are going to ask all the questions, we must keep
it fairly brief</p>

<p align="center"><b>Earl of Selborne</b></p>

<p>132. I will forgo my question but just ask what were the
bright ideas Lord May wanted to put into the discussion.</p>

<p><i>(Lord May of Oxford)</i> One thing I would have answered
was the question about the Systematics Forum. There is in
taxonomy a list of things we ought to ask questions about. Some
of them are just factual and some are background to doing things.
Two of them I have referred to already. One of them is, it would
be good if somebody really could do a more analytic study on the
demography of taxonomists in two respects. One is the age
spectrum. The Dainton Report had the age structure but it did not
compare it with the average age structure of academia. Is it
indeed true that the cadre of practising alpha-taxonomists in the
UK today has an age profile which is characteristic of a species
heading for extinction, or is it just that they are a fair
fraction of older people in academia more generally as a result
of various factors. Secondly, within the first one of the
demography of taxonomists, a little more analytic study of what
they work on and the degree to which fashion rather than analysis
of the job to be done drives it. Secondly, the thing I touched
on, it would be good to have an analysis of what are the
under-graduate and masters courses taught in the UK and how have
they changed over time. Is it true there are fewer? This is the
sort of thing they would have been doing but it is not the sort
of thing they do, which is exasperating in my view. It is what
the Systematics Forum should have done. I hectored them but just
could not get it done. I have some constructive comments. I have
said that each year we add to the total of the known species
about another 10,000, but I cannot tell you how much that costs
per species. It would be very useful to have accounts to give to
the research councils and more of a sense of the cost of the
enterprise as we currently do it. Then, looking to the future, I
would like to see the discipline ask itself, as it is beginning
to, how can we go about the task of seeking out in a systematic
way new species in novel and imaginative ways. There is quite an
enterprise on this and it has begun, which I will not go into
technically, and a lot of people are thinking about it, but it
would be nice to see more thought go into that and moving away to
a faster if slightly sloppier process than the thing we have,
because the rate limiting step of adding to our knowledge of the
creatures and plants we share the world with is always going to
be collecting them. I would also like to see preliminary thinking
about something which is going in my view to come over the next
ten or 20 years and is going to upset greatly a lot of
conventional taxonomists, which is the step we really can speed
up greatly. I believe ten or 20 years from now, when you have
collected in the field a new species but you do not know whether
it is new or not, you put a little bit of it into a large widget
which will first of all seek for particular genes and then go
straight through to place it in the phylogenetic tree of life, so
that the process which currently takes roughly twice as long as
collecting things in the field, the process of keying them out,
will take ten minutes, so you will have shortened the task. Most
people do not even realise at present one of the most
widely-cited dramatic upward revisions of how many species there
are on earth comes from a chap who looked at beetles in the
canopies of tropical trees, and he has never keyed out the
collection, he has used a chain of theoretical arguments to
estimate how many are new to science. The reason he has not keyed
it out is it would have taken him several years and it would have
been very boring. But that involves a completely different cast
of characters, the kind of people who gave us the gene sequencing
machines. We need people to be thinking ahead to that and getting
together and putting proposals together in the same imaginative
way as people like Walter Bodmer and others did to start on human
genomes 20 years ago. Finally, we need not merely the
getting-together of the alpha-taxonomists with people more
skilled in information technology but the making of machines to
do the things that machines can do, which is not collecting in
the field, but looking across the sweep of the tasks to be done,
whether it is vertebrates, invertebrates, and looking at the
things we have at the moment. The Natural History Museum has to
make agonising choices of which aspects of the collection it
continues to foster and do scholarships on and build, and those
where it will just curate the work in a holding operation. People
keep talking about co-ordinating this so we share it, but there
is not much room for co-ordinating in the UK because there is for
animals just one big institution and a few smaller ones, and for
plants there are two big ones and some smaller ones.
Internationally so far there has been endless talk and no action.
There is a set of things which, if you could do them, could begin
to build something. The conservation movement has the red data
books of categories of endangerment, and they could be in a sense
drawn into this too. I would have liked to see the UK bid to have
the Global Biodiversity Informatics Facility, which is beginning
to be established, because I think we have people who might have
helped supply this vision, but the relevant department just felt
it had enough calls on its expenditure and was not willing to do
it.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Chairman</b></p>

<p>133. Lord May, the consequence of your suggestion that in
future we will have a portable field-sized sequencer ---</p>

<p><i>(Lord May of Oxford)</i> Not portable, no. You have to
bring it back home, but that is no problem.</p>

<p>134. --- some form of rapid sequencer, indicates that you
consider it to be absolutely crucial that we establish a
structure which will enable us to foster these collecting skills
and the in-depth knowledge of the genera and species which would
enable people in the field to recognise they have something new.
Would that be a reasonable summary?</p>

<p>(Lord May of Oxford) I am actually saying something which many
of that community would regard as an anathema. That is my vision
of the future of this discipline, basic alpha-taxonomy,
collecting things, seeing whether they are new and establishing
that. At the moment that community will go into the field, but
some of them will not even go into the field, they will just work
on the past collections. I am proposing in a sense to abolish the
work on the past collections because that will be done for you. I
see that as being helpful - but of course it will never work out
exactly like that - because the young people who get into
entomological clubs and the like are exactly the people who want
the romance of the collecting. The great majority of those bright
young people would see alpha-taxonomy research work, the tedious
keying out, as just boring, and thus they shy away from it,
because that seems to be what it is about. The ones who want the
romance will become ecologists and go and study things,
handicapped by the lack of knowledge of alpha-taxonomy.</p>

<p>135. Sadly, we have not got time for the other questions we
had for you, but I think we have covered most of the ground you
would have liked to cover in answer to our questions.</p>

<p><i>(Lord May of Oxford)</i> I think we have covered everything
I wanted to say but I would just want to say one last thing,
which is, why should, after all, the UK do this? We have been
talking about the need scientifically but there is a finite
amount of things we can do so why should we do this? Why should
not someone else do it? I would say there are two reasons why the
UK should do this. One of them is, it is an area where we have a
comparative advantage. Our imperial past has simply given us
strengths of collections and strengths of traditions. Secondly,
and more morally, we have an obligation. Our imperial past has
given us the reference collections for many parts of the
developing world. I think the Darwin Initiative was a great start
and it really has done a lot. I was rather shocked at what I
conceived to be your draft Question 7 which you were going to ask
on the basis of a statement from officials at DEFRA, who said
that the Convention for Biological Diversity sets out a
potentially endless task in terms of identifying organisms.
Someone who drafted that should help explain why we have done
such a dreadful job of not carrying our end of the burden given
by the Convention for Biological Diversity of helping to conserve
things in the dependent territories.</p>

<p>136. On that point, thank you very much indeed. Lord May, and
also your colleague.</p>

<p><i>(Lord May of Oxford)</i> Thank you very much.</p>
